| Method
| Description

| [[write]] `write`
| Writes a sequence of records (for a RDD partition) to a shuffle system when a link:spark-taskscheduler-ShuffleMapTask.adoc#runTask[`ShuffleMapTask` writes its execution result].

| [[stop]] `stop`
| Closes a `ShuffleWriter` and returns link:spark-MapStatus.adoc[MapStatus] if the writing completed successfully.

Used when a link:spark-taskscheduler-ShuffleMapTask.adoc#runTask[`ShuffleMapTask` finishes execution] with the input `success` flag to match the status of the task execution.
