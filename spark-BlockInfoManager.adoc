== [[BlockInfoManager]] BlockInfoManager

`BlockInfoManager` manages <<infos, memory blocks>> (aka _memory pages_). It controls concurrent access to memory blocks by <<lockForReading, read>> and <<lockForWriting, write>> locks (for existing and <<lockNewBlockForWriting, new ones>>).

NOTE: *Locks* are the mechanism to control concurrent access to data and prevent destructive interaction between operations that use the same resource.

.`BlockInfoManager` Internal Registries and Counters
[cols="1,2",options="header",width="100%"]
|===
| Name | Description
| [[infos]] `infos` | Tracks link:spark-BlockInfo.adoc[BlockInfo] per block (as link:spark-blockdatamanager.adoc[BlockId]).
| [[readLocksByTask]] `readLocksByTask` | Tracks tasks (by `TaskAttemptId`) and the blocks they locked for reading (as <<BlockId, BlockId>>).
| [[writeLocksByTask]] `writeLocksByTask` | Tracks tasks (by `TaskAttemptId`) and the blocks they locked for writing (as <<BlockId, BlockId>>).
|===

NOTE: `BlockInfoManager` is a `private[storage]` class that belongs to `org.apache.spark.storage` package.

[TIP]
====
Enable `TRACE` logging level for `org.apache.spark.storage.BlockInfoManager` logger to see what happens inside.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

```
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.storage.BlockInfoManager=TRACE
```

Refer to link:spark-logging.adoc[Logging].

=== [[registerTask]] `registerTask` Method

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[downgradeLock]] Downgrading Exclusive Write Lock For Block to Shared Read Lock -- `downgradeLock` Method

[source, scala]
----
downgradeLock(blockId: BlockId): Unit
----

`downgradeLock`...FIXME

=== [[lockForReading]] Obtaining Read Lock For Block -- `lockForReading` Method

[source, scala]
----
lockForReading(
  blockId: BlockId,
  blocking: Boolean = true): Option[BlockInfo]
----

`lockForReading` locks `blockId` memory block for reading when the block was registered earlier and no writer tasks use it.

When executed, `lockForReading` prints out the following TRACE message to the logs:

```
TRACE BlockInfoManager: Task [currentTaskAttemptId] trying to acquire read lock for [blockId]
```

`lockForReading` looks up the metadata of the `blockId` block (in <<infos, infos>> registry).

If no metadata could be found, it returns `None` which means that the block does not exist or was removed (and anybody could acquire a write lock).

Otherwise, when the metadata was found, i.e. registered, it checks so-called _writerTask_. Only when the link:spark-BlockInfo.adoc#NO_WRITER[block has no writer tasks], a read lock can be acquired. If so, the `readerCount` of the block metadata is incremented and the block is recorded (in the internal <<readLocksByTask, readLocksByTask>> registry). You should see the following TRACE message in the logs:

```
TRACE BlockInfoManager: Task [taskAttemptId] acquired read lock for [blockId]
```

The `BlockInfo` for the `blockId` block is returned.

NOTE: `-1024` is a special `taskAttemptId`, _aka_ link:spark-BlockInfo.adoc#NON_TASK_WRITER[NON_TASK_WRITER], used to mark a non-task thread, e.g. by a driver thread or by unit test code.

For blocks with link:spark-BlockInfo.adoc#NO_WRITER[`writerTask` other than `NO_WRITER`], when `blocking` is enabled, `lockForReading` waits (until another thread invokes the `Object.notify` method or the `Object.notifyAll` methods for this object).

With `blocking` enabled, it will repeat the waiting-for-read-lock sequence until either `None` or the lock is obtained.

When `blocking` is disabled and the lock could not be obtained, `None` is returned immediately.

NOTE: `lockForReading` is a `synchronized` method, i.e. no two objects can use this and other instance methods.

=== [[lockForWriting]] Obtaining Write Lock for Block -- `lockForWriting` Method

[source, scala]
----
lockForWriting(
  blockId: BlockId,
  blocking: Boolean = true): Option[BlockInfo]
----

When executed, `lockForWriting` prints out the following TRACE message to the logs:

```
TRACE Task [currentTaskAttemptId] trying to acquire write lock for [blockId]
```

It looks up `blockId` in the internal <<infos, infos>> registry. When no link:spark-BlockInfo.adoc[BlockInfo] could be found, `None` is returned. Otherwise, link:spark-BlockInfo.adoc#NO_WRITER[`blockId` block is checked for `writerTask` to be `BlockInfo.NO_WRITER`] with no readers (i.e. `readerCount` is `0`) and only then the lock is returned.

When the write lock can be returned, `BlockInfo.writerTask` is set to `currentTaskAttemptId` and a new binding is added to the internal <<writeLocksByTask, writeLocksByTask>> registry. You should see the following TRACE message in the logs:

```
TRACE Task [currentTaskAttemptId] acquired write lock for [blockId]
```

If, for some reason, link:spark-BlockInfo.adoc#writerTask[`blockId` has a writer] or the number of readers is positive (i.e. `BlockInfo.readerCount` is greater than `0`), the method will wait (based on the input `blocking` flag) and attempt the write lock acquisition process until it finishes with a write lock.

NOTE: (deadlock possible) The method is `synchronized` and can block, i.e. `wait` that causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes `Object.notify` or `Object.notifyAll` methods for this object.

`lockForWriting` return `None` for no `blockId` in the internal <<infos, infos>> registry or when `blocking` flag is disabled and the write lock could not be acquired.

=== [[lockNewBlockForWriting]] Obtaining Write Lock for New Block -- `lockNewBlockForWriting` Method

[source, scala]
----
lockNewBlockForWriting(
  blockId: BlockId,
  newBlockInfo: BlockInfo): Boolean
----

`lockNewBlockForWriting` obtains a write lock for `blockId` but only when the method could register the block.

NOTE: `lockNewBlockForWriting` is similar to <<lockForWriting, lockForWriting>> method but for brand new blocks.

When executed, `lockNewBlockForWriting` prints out the following TRACE message to the logs:

```
TRACE Task [currentTaskAttemptId] trying to put [blockId]
```

If <<lockForReading, some other thread has already created the block>>, it finishes returning `false`. Otherwise, when the block does not exist, `newBlockInfo` is recorded in the internal <<infos, infos>> registry and <<lockForWriting, the block is locked for this client for writing>>. It then returns `true`.

NOTE: `lockNewBlockForWriting` executes itself in `synchronized` block so once the BlockInfoManager is locked the other internal registries should be available only for the currently-executing thread.

=== [[currentTaskAttemptId]] `currentTaskAttemptId` Method

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[unlock]] Releasing Lock on Block -- `unlock` Method

[source, scala]
----
unlock(blockId: BlockId): Unit
----

`unlock` releases...FIXME

When executed, `unlock` starts by printing out the following TRACE message to the logs:

```
TRACE BlockInfoManager: Task [currentTaskAttemptId] releasing lock for [blockId]
```

`unlock` gets the metadata for `blockId`. It may throw a `IllegalStateException` if the block was not found.

If the link:spark-BlockInfo.adoc#writerTask[writer task] for the block is not link:spark-BlockInfo.adoc#NO_WRITER[NO_WRITER], it becomes so and the `blockId` block is removed from the internal <<writeLocksByTask, writeLocksByTask>> registry for the <<currentTaskAttemptId, current task attempt>>.

Otherwise, if the writer task is indeed `NO_WRITER`, it is assumed that the link:spark-BlockInfo.adoc#readerCount[`blockId` block is locked for reading]. The `readerCount` counter is decremented for the `blockId` block and the read lock removed from the internal <<readLocksByTask, readLocksByTask>> registry for the <<currentTaskAttemptId, current task attempt>>.

In the end, `unlock` wakes up all the threads waiting for the `BlockInfoManager` (using Java's link:++https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#notifyAll--++[Object.notifyAll]).
