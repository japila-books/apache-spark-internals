== [[SparkPlan]] SparkPlan -- Physical Query Plan / Physical Operator

`SparkPlan` is the base link:spark-sql-catalyst-QueryPlan.adoc[Catalyst query plan] for *physical operators* that used (_composed_) together build a *physical query plan* (aka _query execution plan_).

[NOTE]
====
A physical operator is a link:spark-sql-catalyst-TreeNode.adoc[Catalyst node] that may have zero or more link:spark-sql-catalyst-TreeNode.adoc#children[children].

Spark SQL uses link:spark-sql-catalyst.adoc[Catalyst] (tree manipulation framework) to compose nodes to build a tree that, in this context, translates to composing physical plan nodes to build a physical plan tree.
====

When <<execute, executed>>, a physical operator produces an RDD of rows (in the link:spark-sql-InternalRow.adoc[internal binary row format]).

NOTE: <<execute, execute>> is called when `QueryExecution` is requested for an link:spark-sql-QueryExecution.adoc#toRdd[RDD] which happens exactly when your query is executed.

[TIP]
====
Use link:spark-sql-dataset-operators.adoc#explain[explain] operator to see the execution plan of a structured query.

[source, scala]
----
val q = // your query here
q.explain
----

You may also access the execution plan of a `Dataset` using its link:spark-sql-Dataset.adoc#queryExecution[queryExecution] property.

[source, scala]
----
val q = // your query here
q.queryExecution.sparkPlan
----
====

The <<contract, SparkPlan contract>> assumes that concrete physical operators define <<doExecute, doExecute>> method (with optional <<hooks, hooks>> like <<doPrepare, doPrepare>>) which are executed when the physical operator is <<execute, executed>>.

CAUTION: FIXME A picture with methods/hooks called.

CAUTION: FIXME `SparkPlan` is `Serializable`. Why?

.SparkPlan's Final Methods
[cols="1,3",options="header",width="100%"]
|===
| Name
| Description

| [[execute]] `execute`
a| Executes a physical operator that generates an `RDD` of link:spark-sql-InternalRow.adoc[internal binary rows].

[source, scala]
----
final def execute(): RDD[InternalRow]
----

Used _most importantly_ when `QueryExecution` is requested for a <<toRdd, RDD>> (that in turn triggers execution of any children the physical operator may have as children).

Internally, `execute` executes <<doExecute, doExecute>> in a <<executeQuery, named scope>>.

NOTE: Executing `doExecute` in a named scope happens only after the operator is <<prepare, prepared for execution>> followed by <<waitForSubqueries, waiting for any subqueries to finish>>.

| [[prepare]] `prepare`
| Prepares a query for execution.

Internally, `prepare` calls <<doPrepare, doPrepare>> of its link:spark-sql-catalyst-TreeNode.adoc#children[children] first followed by <<prepareSubqueries, prepareSubqueries>> and <<doPrepare, doPrepare>>.

| <<executeBroadcast, executeBroadcast>>
| Calls <<doExecuteBroadcast, doExecuteBroadcast>>

| Name
| Description

| [[BinaryExecNode]] `BinaryExecNode`
| Binary physical operator with two child `left` and `right` physical operators

| [[LeafExecNode]] `LeafExecNode`
| Leaf physical operator with no children

By default, the link:spark-sql-catalyst-QueryPlan.adoc#producedAttributes[set of all attributes that are produced] is exactly the link:spark-sql-catalyst-QueryPlan.adoc#outputSet[set of attributes that are output].

| [[UnaryExecNode]] `UnaryExecNode`
| Unary physical operator with one `child` physical operator
|===

NOTE: The naming convention for physical operators in Spark's source code is to have their names end with the *Exec* prefix, e.g. `DebugExec` or link:spark-sql-SparkPlan-LocalTableScanExec.adoc[LocalTableScanExec] that is however removed when the operator is displayed, e.g. in link:spark-webui-sql.adoc[web UI].

=== [[decodeUnsafeRows]] `decodeUnsafeRows` Method

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[prepareSubqueries]] `prepareSubqueries` Method

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[getByteArrayRdd]] `getByteArrayRdd` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
getByteArrayRdd(n: Int = -1): RDD[Array[Byte]]
----

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[waitForSubqueries]] `waitForSubqueries` Method

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[executeCollect]] `executeCollect` Method

CAUTION: FIXME

NOTE: `executeCollect` does not convert data to JVM types.

=== [[executeToIterator]] `executeToIterator` Method

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[contract]] SparkPlan Contract

`SparkPlan` contract requires that concrete physical operators define their own custom `doExecute`.

[[doExecute]]
[source, scala]
----
doExecute(): RDD[InternalRow]
----

`doExecute` produces the result of a structured query as an `RDD` of link:spark-sql-InternalRow.adoc[internal binary rows].

[[hooks]]
.SparkPlan's Extension Hooks (in alphabetical order)
[cols="1,2",options="header",width="100%"]
|===
| Name
| Description

| [[doExecuteBroadcast]] `doExecuteBroadcast`
a|

By default reports a `UnsupportedOperationException`.

```
[nodeName] does not implement doExecuteBroadcast
```

Executed exclusively as part of <<executeBroadcast, executeBroadcast>> to return the result of a structured query as a broadcast variable.

| [[doPrepare]] `doPrepare`
| Prepares a physical operator for execution.

Executed exclusively as part of <<prepare, prepare>> and is supposed to set some state up before executing a query (e.g. link:spark-sql-SparkPlan-BroadcastExchangeExec.adoc#doPrepare[BroadcastExchangeExec] to broadcast asynchronously).

| [[outputPartitioning]] `outputPartitioning`
| Specifies how data is partitioned across different nodes in the cluster

| [[requiredChildDistribution]] `requiredChildDistribution`
a| Required *partition requirements* (_aka_ *child output distributions*) of the input data, i.e. how link:spark-sql-catalyst-TreeNode.adoc#children[children] physical operators' output is split across partitions.

[source, scala]
----
requiredChildDistribution: Seq[Distribution]
----

Defaults to `UnspecifiedDistribution` for all of the physical operator's link:spark-sql-catalyst-TreeNode.adoc#children[children].

Used exclusively when `EnsureRequirements` physical preparation rule link:spark-sql-EnsureRequirements.adoc#ensureDistributionAndOrdering[enforces partition requirements of a physical operator].

| [[requiredChildOrdering]] `requiredChildOrdering`
a| Specifies required sort ordering for each partition requirement (from link:spark-sql-catalyst-TreeNode.adoc#children[children] operators)

[source, scala]
----
requiredChildOrdering: Seq[Seq[SortOrder]]
----

Defaults to no sort ordering for all of the physical operator's link:spark-sql-catalyst-TreeNode.adoc#children[children].

Used exclusively when `EnsureRequirements` physical preparation rule link:spark-sql-EnsureRequirements.adoc#ensureDistributionAndOrdering[enforces sort requirements of a physical operator].
|===

=== [[executeQuery]] Executing Query in Scope (after Preparations) -- `executeQuery` Final Method

[source, scala]
----
executeQuery[T](query: => T): T
----

`executeQuery` executes `query` in a scope (i.e. so that all RDDs created will have the same scope for visualization like web UI).

Internally, `executeQuery` calls <<prepare, prepare>> and <<waitForSubqueries, waitForSubqueries>> followed by executing `query`.

NOTE: `executeQuery` is executed as part of <<execute, execute>>, <<executeBroadcast, executeBroadcast>> and when ``CodegenSupport``-enabled physical operator link:spark-sql-CodegenSupport.adoc#produce[produces a Java source code].

=== [[executeBroadcast]] Broadcasting Result of Structured Query -- `executeBroadcast` Final Method

[source, scala]
----
executeBroadcast[T](): broadcast.Broadcast[T]
----

`executeBroadcast` returns the result of a structured query as a broadcast variable.

Internally, `executeBroadcast` calls <<doExecuteBroadcast, doExecuteBroadcast>> inside <<executeQuery, executeQuery>>.

NOTE: `executeBroadcast` is called in link:spark-sql-SparkPlan-BroadcastHashJoinExec.adoc[BroadcastHashJoinExec], link:spark-sql-SparkPlan-BroadcastNestedLoopJoinExec.adoc[BroadcastNestedLoopJoinExec] and `ReusedExchangeExec` physical operators.

=== [[metrics]] metrics Internal Registry

[source, scala]
----
metrics: Map[String, SQLMetric] = Map.empty
----

`metrics` is a registry of supported link:spark-sql-SQLMetric.adoc[SQLMetrics] by their names.

=== [[executeTake]] Taking First N UnsafeRows -- `executeTake` Method

[source, scala]
----
executeTake(n: Int): Array[InternalRow]
----

`executeTake` gives an array of up to `n` first link:spark-sql-InternalRow.adoc[internal rows].

.SparkPlan's executeTake takes 5 elements
image::images/spark-sql-SparkPlan-executeTake.png[align="center"]

Internally, `executeTake` <<getByteArrayRdd, gets an RDD of byte array of `n` unsafe rows>> and scans the RDD partitions one by one until `n` is reached or all partitions were processed.

`executeTake` runs Spark jobs that take all the elements from requested number of partitions, starting from the 0th partition and increasing their number by link:spark-sql-SQLConf.adoc#spark.sql.limit.scaleUpFactor[spark.sql.limit.scaleUpFactor] property (but minimum twice as many).

NOTE: `executeTake` uses `SparkContext.runJob` to run a Spark job.

In the end, `executeTake` <<decodeUnsafeRows, decodes the unsafe rows>>.

NOTE: `executeTake` gives an empty collection when `n` is 0 (and no Spark job is executed).

NOTE: `executeTake` may take and decode more unsafe rows than really needed since all unsafe rows from a partition are read (if the partition is included in the scan).
