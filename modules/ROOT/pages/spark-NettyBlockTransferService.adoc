== [[NettyBlockTransferService]] NettyBlockTransferService -- Netty-Based BlockTransferService

`NettyBlockTransferService` is a link:spark-BlockTransferService.adoc[BlockTransferService] that uses Netty for <<uploadBlock, uploading>> or <<fetchBlocks, fetching>> blocks of data.

`NettyBlockTransferService` is <<creating-instance, created>> when `SparkEnv` is link:spark-SparkEnv.adoc#create-NettyBlockTransferService[created] for the driver and executors (to link:spark-SparkEnv.adoc#create-BlockManager[create the BlockManager]).

`BlockManager` uses `NettyBlockTransferService` for the following:

* FIXME (should it be here or in BlockManager?)

* link:spark-BlockManager.adoc#shuffleClient[ShuffleClient] (when `spark.shuffle.service.enabled` configuration property is off) for...FIXME

[[port]]
`NettyBlockTransferService` simply requests the <<server, TransportServer>> for the link:spark-TransportServer.adoc#getPort[port].

[[logging]]
[TIP]
====
Enable `INFO` or `TRACE` logging level for `org.apache.spark.network.netty.NettyBlockTransferService` logger to see what happens inside.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

```
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.network.netty.NettyBlockTransferService=TRACE
```

Refer to link:spark-logging.adoc[Logging].

=== [[fetchBlocks]] `fetchBlocks` Method

[source, scala]
----
fetchBlocks(
  host: String,
  port: Int,
  execId: String,
  blockIds: Array[String],
  listener: BlockFetchingListener): Unit
----

NOTE: `fetchBlocks` is part of link:spark-BlockTransferService.adoc#fetchBlocks[BlockTransferService Contract] to...FIXME.

When executed, `fetchBlocks` prints out the following TRACE message in the logs:

```
TRACE Fetch blocks from [host]:[port] (executor id [execId])
```

`fetchBlocks` then creates a `RetryingBlockFetcher.BlockFetchStarter` where `createAndStart` method...FIXME

Depending on the maximum number of acceptable IO exceptions (such as connection timeouts) per request, if the number is greater than `0`, `fetchBlocks` creates a link:spark-RetryingBlockFetcher.adoc#creating-instance[RetryingBlockFetcher] and link:spark-RetryingBlockFetcher.adoc#start[starts] it immediately.

NOTE: `RetryingBlockFetcher` is created with the `RetryingBlockFetcher.BlockFetchStarter` created earlier, the input `blockIds` and `listener`.

If however the number of retries is not greater than `0` (it could be `0` or less), the `RetryingBlockFetcher.BlockFetchStarter` created earlier is started (with the input `blockIds` and `listener`).

In case of any `Exception`, you should see the following ERROR message in the logs and the input `BlockFetchingListener` gets notified (using `onBlockFetchFailure` for every block id).

```
ERROR Exception while beginning fetchBlocks
```

=== [[appId]] Application Id -- `appId` Property

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[close]] Closing NettyBlockTransferService -- `close` Method

[source, scala]
----
close(): Unit
----

NOTE: `close` is part of the link:spark-BlockTransferService.adoc#close[BlockTransferService Contract].

`close`...FIXME

=== [[init]] Initializing NettyBlockTransferService -- `init` Method

[source, scala]
----
init(blockDataManager: BlockDataManager): Unit
----

NOTE: `init` is part of the link:spark-BlockTransferService.adoc#init[BlockTransferService Contract].

`init` starts a server for...FIXME

Internally, `init` link:spark-NettyBlockRpcServer.adoc#creating-instance[creates a `NettyBlockRpcServer`] (using the application id, a `JavaSerializer` and the input `blockDataManager`).

CAUTION: FIXME Describe security when `authEnabled` is enabled.

`init` creates a `TransportContext` with the `NettyBlockRpcServer` created earlier.

CAUTION: FIXME Describe `transportConf` and `TransportContext`.

`init` creates the internal `clientFactory` and a server.

CAUTION: FIXME What's the "a server"?

In the end, you should see the INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO NettyBlockTransferService: Server created on [hostName]:[port]
```

NOTE: `hostname` is given when link:spark-SparkEnv.adoc#NettyBlockTransferService[`NettyBlockTransferService` is created] and is controlled by link:spark-driver.adoc#spark_driver_host[`spark.driver.host` Spark property] for the driver and differs per deployment environment for executors (as controlled by link:spark-CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend.adoc#main[`--hostname` for `CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend`]).

=== [[uploadBlock]] Uploading Block -- `uploadBlock` Method

[source, scala]
----
uploadBlock(
  hostname: String,
  port: Int,
  execId: String,
  blockId: BlockId,
  blockData: ManagedBuffer,
  level: StorageLevel,
  classTag: ClassTag[_]): Future[Unit]
----

NOTE: `uploadBlock` is part of the link:spark-BlockTransferService.adoc#uploadBlock[BlockTransferService Contract].

Internally, `uploadBlock` creates a `TransportClient` client to send a <<UploadBlock, `UploadBlock` message>> (to the input `hostname` and `port`).

NOTE: `UploadBlock` message is processed by link:spark-NettyBlockRpcServer.adoc[NettyBlockRpcServer].

The `UploadBlock` message holds the <<appId, application id>>, the input `execId` and `blockId`. It also holds the serialized bytes for block metadata with `level` and `classTag` serialized (using the internal `JavaSerializer`) as well as the serialized bytes for the input `blockData` itself (this time however the serialization uses link:spark-BlockDataManager.adoc#ManagedBuffer[`ManagedBuffer.nioByteBuffer` method]).

The entire `UploadBlock` message is further serialized before sending (using `TransportClient.sendRpc`).

CAUTION: FIXME Describe `TransportClient` and `clientFactory.createClient`.

When `blockId` block was successfully uploaded, you should see the following TRACE message in the logs:

```
TRACE NettyBlockTransferService: Successfully uploaded block [blockId]
```

When an upload failed, you should see the following ERROR message in the logs:

```
ERROR Error while uploading block [blockId]
```

=== [[UploadBlock]] `UploadBlock` Message

`UploadBlock` is a `BlockTransferMessage` that describes a block being uploaded, i.e. send over the wire from a <<uploadBlock, NettyBlockTransferService>> to a link:spark-NettyBlockRpcServer.adoc#UploadBlock[NettyBlockRpcServer].

.`UploadBlock` Attributes
[cols="1,2",options="header",width="100%"]
|===
| Attribute | Description
| `appId` | The application id (the block belongs to)
| `execId` | The executor id
| `blockId` | The block id
| `metadata` |
| `blockData` | The block data as an array of bytes
|===

As an `Encodable`, `UploadBlock` can calculate the encoded size and do encoding and decoding itself to or from a `ByteBuf`, respectively.

=== [[createServer]] `createServer` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
createServer(bootstraps: List[TransportServerBootstrap]): TransportServer
----

`createServer`...FIXME

NOTE: `createServer` is used exclusively when `NettyBlockTransferService` is requested to <<init, init>>.

=== [[creating-instance]] Creating NettyBlockTransferService Instance

`NettyBlockTransferService` takes the following when created:

* [[conf]] link:spark-SparkConf.adoc[SparkConf]
* [[securityManager]] `SecurityManager`
* [[bindAddress]] Bind address to bind to
* [[hostName]] Host name to bind to
* [[_port]] Port number
* [[numCores]] Number of CPU cores

`NettyBlockTransferService` initializes the <<internal-registries, internal registries and counters>>.
