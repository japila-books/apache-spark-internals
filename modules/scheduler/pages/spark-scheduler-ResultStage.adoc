= [[ResultStage]] ResultStage

A `ResultStage` is the final stage in a job that applies a function on one or many partitions of the target RDD to compute the result of an action.

.Job creates ResultStage as the first stage

The partitions are given as a collection of partition ids (`partitions`) and the function `func: (TaskContext, Iterator[_]) => _`.

TIP: Read about `TaskContext` in xref:scheduler:spark-TaskContext.adoc[TaskContext].

In the above figure, partitions 1 and 2 are not finished (`F` is false while `T` is true).

`activeJob` returns the optional `ActiveJob` associated with a `ResultStage`.

CAUTION: FIXME When/why would that be `NONE` (empty)?
