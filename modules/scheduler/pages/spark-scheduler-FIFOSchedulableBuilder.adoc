== FIFOSchedulableBuilder - SchedulableBuilder for FIFO Scheduling Mode

`FIFOSchedulableBuilder` is a <<SchedulableBuilder, SchedulableBuilder>> that holds a single link:spark-scheduler-Pool.adoc[Pool] (that is given when <<creating-instance, `FIFOSchedulableBuilder` is created>>).

NOTE: `FIFOSchedulableBuilder` is the link:spark-scheduler-TaskSchedulerImpl.adoc#creating-instance[default `SchedulableBuilder` for `TaskSchedulerImpl`].

NOTE: When `FIFOSchedulableBuilder` is created, the `TaskSchedulerImpl` passes its own `rootPool` (a part of xref:scheduler:TaskScheduler.adoc#contract[TaskScheduler Contract]).

`FIFOSchedulableBuilder` obeys the <<contract, SchedulableBuilder Contract>> as follows:

* <<buildPools, buildPools>> does nothing.
* `addTaskSetManager` link:spark-scheduler-Pool.adoc#addSchedulable[passes the input `Schedulable` to the one and only rootPool Pool (using `addSchedulable`)] and completely disregards the properties of the Schedulable.

=== [[creating-instance]] Creating FIFOSchedulableBuilder Instance

`FIFOSchedulableBuilder` takes the following when created:
