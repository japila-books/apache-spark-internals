= [[IndexShuffleBlockResolver]] IndexShuffleBlockResolver

*IndexShuffleBlockResolver* is a concrete <<ShuffleBlockResolver.adoc#, ShuffleBlockResolver>> that manages shuffle block data and uses *shuffle index files* for faster shuffle data access.

IndexShuffleBlockResolver can <<writeIndexFileAndCommit, write>>, <<getBlockData, look up>> and <<removeDataByMap, remove>> shuffle block index and data files (given shuffle and
map IDs).

IndexShuffleBlockResolver is <<creating-instance, created>> and managed by xref:SortShuffleManager.adoc#shuffleBlockResolver[SortShuffleManager] (so it xref:ShuffleManager.adoc#shuffleBlockResolver[can access shuffle block data]).

.SortShuffleManager creates IndexShuffleBlockResolver

IndexShuffleBlockResolver is later used to create the xref:SortShuffleManager.adoc#getWriter[ShuffleWriter] given a xref:spark-shuffle-ShuffleHandle.adoc[ShuffleHandle].

== [[creating-instance]] Creating IndexShuffleBlockResolver Instance

IndexShuffleBlockResolver takes the following to be created:

* [[conf]] xref:ROOT:spark-SparkConf.adoc[SparkConf]
* [[_blockManager]][[blockManager]] xref:ROOT:BlockManager.adoc[BlockManager]

IndexShuffleBlockResolver initializes the <<internal-properties, internal properties>>.

== [[writeIndexFileAndCommit]] Writing Shuffle Index and Data Files -- `writeIndexFileAndCommit` Method

[source, scala]
----
writeIndexFileAndCommit(
  shuffleId: Int,
  mapId: Int,
  lengths: Array[Long],
  dataTmp: File): Unit
----

Internally, `writeIndexFileAndCommit` first <<getIndexFile, finds the index file>> for the input `shuffleId` and `mapId`.

`writeIndexFileAndCommit` creates a temporary file for the index file (in the same directory) and writes offsets (as the moving sum of the input `lengths` starting from 0 to the final offset at the end for the end of the output file).

NOTE: The offsets are the sizes in the input `lengths` exactly.

.writeIndexFileAndCommit and offsets in a shuffle index file
image::IndexShuffleBlockResolver-writeIndexFileAndCommit.png[align="center"]

`writeIndexFileAndCommit` <<getDataFile, requests a shuffle block data file>> for the input `shuffleId` and `mapId`.

`writeIndexFileAndCommit` <<checkIndexAndDataFile, checks if the given index and data files match each other>> (aka _consistency check_).

If the consistency check fails, it means that another attempt for the same task has already written the map outputs successfully and so the input `dataTmp` and temporary index files are deleted (as no longer correct).

If the consistency check succeeds, the existing index and data files are deleted (if they exist) and the temporary index and data files become "official", i.e. renamed to their final names.

In case of any IO-related exception, `writeIndexFileAndCommit` throws a `IOException` with the messages:

```
fail to rename file [indexTmp] to [indexFile]
```

or

```
fail to rename file [dataTmp] to [dataFile]
```

NOTE: `writeIndexFileAndCommit` is used when link:spark-shuffle-ShuffleWriter.adoc[ShuffleWriters] are requested to write records to a shuffle system, i.e. link:spark-shuffle-SortShuffleWriter.adoc#write[SortShuffleWriter], link:spark-shuffle-BypassMergeSortShuffleWriter.adoc#write[BypassMergeSortShuffleWriter], and link:spark-shuffle-UnsafeShuffleWriter.adoc#closeAndWriteOutput[UnsafeShuffleWriter].

== [[getBlockData]] Creating ManagedBuffer to Read Shuffle Block Data File -- `getBlockData` Method

[source, scala]
----
getBlockData(blockId: ShuffleBlockId): ManagedBuffer
----

NOTE: `getBlockData` is part of xref:ShuffleBlockResolver.adoc#getBlockData[ShuffleBlockResolver] contract.

Internally, `getBlockData` <<getIndexFile, finds the index file>> for the input shuffle `blockId`.

NOTE: xref:ROOT:spark-BlockDataManager.adoc#ShuffleBlockId[ShuffleBlockId] knows `shuffleId` and `mapId`.

`getBlockData` discards `blockId.reduceId` bytes of data from the index file.

NOTE: `getBlockData` uses Guava's link:++https://google.github.io/guava/releases/snapshot/api/docs/com/google/common/io/ByteStreams.html#skipFully-java.io.InputStream-long-++[com.google.common.io.ByteStreams] to skip the bytes.

`getBlockData` reads the start and end offsets from the index file and then creates a `FileSegmentManagedBuffer` to read the <<getDataFile, data file>> for the offsets (using <<transportConf, transportConf>> internal property).

NOTE: The start and end offsets are the offset and the length of the file segment for the block data.

In the end, `getBlockData` closes the index file.

== [[checkIndexAndDataFile]] Checking Consistency of Shuffle Index and Data Files and Returning Block Lengths --  `checkIndexAndDataFile` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
checkIndexAndDataFile(
  index: File,
  data: File,
  blocks: Int): Array[Long]
----

`checkIndexAndDataFile` first checks if the size of the input `index` file is exactly the input `blocks` multiplied by `8`.

`checkIndexAndDataFile` returns `null` when the numbers, and hence the shuffle index and data files, don't match.

`checkIndexAndDataFile` reads the shuffle `index` file and converts the offsets into lengths of each block.

`checkIndexAndDataFile` makes sure that the size of the input shuffle `data` file is exactly the sum of the block lengths.

`checkIndexAndDataFile` returns the block lengths if the numbers match, and `null` otherwise.

NOTE: `checkIndexAndDataFile` is used exclusively when IndexShuffleBlockResolver is requested to <<writeIndexFileAndCommit, write the shuffle index and data files>> (for shuffle and map IDs).

== [[getIndexFile]] Requesting Shuffle Block Index File (from DiskBlockManager) -- `getIndexFile` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
getIndexFile(shuffleId: Int, mapId: Int): File
----

`getIndexFile` xref:ROOT:BlockManager.adoc#diskBlockManager[requests `BlockManager` for the current `DiskBlockManager`].

NOTE: `getIndexFile` uses xref:ROOT:spark-SparkEnv.adoc#blockManager[`SparkEnv` to access the current `BlockManager`] unless specified when <<creating-instance, IndexShuffleBlockResolver is created>>.

`getIndexFile` then xref:ROOT:spark-DiskBlockManager.adoc#getFile[requests `DiskBlockManager` for the shuffle index file] given the input `shuffleId` and `mapId` (as `ShuffleIndexBlockId`)

NOTE: `getIndexFile` is used when IndexShuffleBlockResolver <<writeIndexFileAndCommit, writes shuffle index and data files>>, <<getBlockData, creates a `ManagedBuffer` to read a shuffle block data file>>, and ultimately <<removeDataByMap, removes the shuffle index and data files>>.

== [[getDataFile]] Requesting Shuffle Block Data File -- `getDataFile` Method

[source, scala]
----
getDataFile(
  shuffleId: Int,
  mapId: Int): File
----

`getDataFile` requests the <<blockManager, BlockManager>> for the xref:ROOT:BlockManager.adoc#diskBlockManager[DiskBlockManager] that is in turn requested for the xref:ROOT:spark-DiskBlockManager.adoc#getFile[shuffle block data file] (for a xref:ROOT:spark-BlockDataManager.adoc#ShuffleDataBlockId[ShuffleDataBlockId])

[NOTE]
====
`getDataFile` is used when:

* IndexShuffleBlockResolver is requested to <<getBlockData, get a ManagedBuffer for block data>>, <<removeDataByMap, removeDataByMap>>, and <<writeIndexFileAndCommit, write shuffle index and data files>>

* xref:spark-shuffle-BypassMergeSortShuffleWriter.adoc#write[BypassMergeSortShuffleWriter], xref:spark-shuffle-UnsafeShuffleWriter.adoc#closeAndWriteOutput[UnsafeShuffleWriter], and xref:spark-shuffle-SortShuffleWriter.adoc#write[SortShuffleWriter] are requested to write records to a shuffle system
====

== [[removeDataByMap]] Removing Shuffle Index and Data Files (For Shuffle and Map IDs) -- `removeDataByMap` Method

[source, scala]
----
removeDataByMap(shuffleId: Int, mapId: Int): Unit
----

`removeDataByMap` <<getDataFile, finds>> and deletes the shuffle data for the input `shuffleId` and `mapId` first followed by <<getIndexFile, finding>> and deleting the shuffle data index file.

When `removeDataByMap` fails deleting the files, `removeDataByMap` prints out the following WARN message to the logs.

```
Error deleting data [path]
```

or

```
Error deleting index [path]
```

NOTE: `removeDataByMap` is used exclusively when `SortShuffleManager` is requested to xref:SortShuffleManager.adoc#unregisterShuffle[unregister a shuffle] (remove a shuffle from a shuffle system).

== [[stop]] Stopping IndexShuffleBlockResolver -- `stop` Method

[source, scala]
----
stop(): Unit
----

NOTE: `stop` is part of link:ShuffleBlockResolver.adoc#stop[ShuffleBlockResolver contract].

`stop` is a noop operation, i.e. does nothing when called.

== [[logging]] Logging

Enable `ALL` logging level for `org.apache.spark.shuffle.IndexShuffleBlockResolver` logger to see what happens inside.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

[source]
----
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.shuffle.IndexShuffleBlockResolver=ALL
----

Refer to xref:ROOT:spark-logging.adoc[Logging].
