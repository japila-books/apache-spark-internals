= [[MemoryManager]] MemoryManager

*MemoryManager* is an abstraction of <<implementations, memory managers>> that manage shared memory for task execution (using xref:memory:TaskMemoryManager.adoc#memoryManager[TaskMemoryManager]) and block storage (using xref:storage:BlockManager.adoc#memoryManager[BlockManager]).

MemoryManager splits available memory into two regions:

* *Execution memory* for computations in shuffles, joins, sorts and aggregations

* *Storage memory* for caching and propagating internal data across Spark nodes

MemoryManager is used to create xref:storage:BlockManager.adoc#memoryManager[BlockManager] (and then xref:storage:MemoryStore.adoc#memoryManager[MemoryStore]) and xref:memory:TaskMemoryManager.adoc#memoryManager[TaskMemoryManager].

MemoryManager is available as xref:core:SparkEnv.adoc#memoryManager[SparkEnv.memoryManager].

[source,scala]
----
import org.apache.spark.SparkEnv
val mm = SparkEnv.get.memoryManager
----

A <<implementations, concrete MemoryManager>> is chosen based on xref:ROOT:configuration-properties.adoc#spark.memory.useLegacyMode[spark.memory.useLegacyMode] configuration property (for xref:core:SparkEnv.adoc#memoryManager[SparkEnv] for the driver and executors).

== [[creating-instance]] Creating Instance

MemoryManager takes the following to be created:

* [[conf]] xref:ROOT:SparkConf.adoc[SparkConf]
* [[numCores]] Number of CPU cores
* [[onHeapStorageMemory]] Size of the on-heap storage memory
* [[onHeapExecutionMemory]] Size of the on-heap execution memory

MemoryManager initializes the <<internal-properties, internal properties>>.

== [[acquireExecutionMemory]] Acquiring Execution Memory for Task

[source, scala]
----
acquireExecutionMemory(
  numBytes: Long,
  taskAttemptId: Long,
  memoryMode: MemoryMode): Long
----

`acquireExecutionMemory` tries to acquire up to `numBytes` of execution memory for the current task (by `taskAttemptId`) and return the number of bytes obtained, or 0 if none can be allocated.

`acquireExecutionMemory` is used when TaskMemoryManager is requested to xref:memory:TaskMemoryManager.adoc#acquireExecutionMemory[acquire execution memory].

== [[acquireStorageMemory]] Acquiring Storage Memory for Block

[source, scala]
----
acquireStorageMemory(
  blockId: BlockId,
  numBytes: Long,
  memoryMode: MemoryMode): Boolean
----

`acquireStorageMemory` tries to acquire `numBytes` bytes of memory to cache the given xref:storage:spark-BlockId.adoc[block], evicting existing ones if necessary.

`acquireStorageMemory` is used when:

* UnifiedMemoryManager is requested to xref:memory:UnifiedMemoryManager.adoc#acquireUnrollMemory[acquireUnrollMemory]

* `MemoryStore` is requested to xref:storage:MemoryStore.adoc#putBytes[putBytes] and xref:storage:MemoryStore.adoc#putIterator[putIterator]

== [[acquireUnrollMemory]] Acquiring Unroll Memory for Block

[source, scala]
----
acquireUnrollMemory(
  blockId: BlockId,
  numBytes: Long,
  memoryMode: MemoryMode): Boolean
----

`acquireUnrollMemory` tries to acquire `numBytes` bytes of memory to unroll the given xref:storage:spark-BlockId.adoc[block], evicting existing ones if necessary.

`acquireUnrollMemory` is used when MemoryStore is requested to xref:storage:MemoryStore.adoc#reserveUnrollMemoryForThisTask[reserveUnrollMemoryForThisTask].

== [[maxOffHeapStorageMemory]] Total Available Off-Heap Storage Memory

[source, scala]
----
maxOffHeapStorageMemory: Long
----

`maxOffHeapStorageMemory` is the total available off-heap memory for storage (in bytes).

`maxOffHeapStorageMemory` may vary over time.

`maxOffHeapStorageMemory` is used when:

* UnifiedMemoryManager is requested to xref:memory:UnifiedMemoryManager.adoc#acquireStorageMemory[acquireStorageMemory]

* BlockManager is xref:storage:BlockManager.adoc#maxOffHeapMemory[created]

* MemoryStore is requested for the xref:storage:MemoryStore.adoc#maxMemory[total amount of memory available]

== [[maxOnHeapStorageMemory]] Total Available On-Heap Storage Memory

[source, scala]
----
maxOnHeapStorageMemory: Long
----

`maxOnHeapStorageMemory` is the total available on-heap memory for storage (in bytes).

`maxOnHeapStorageMemory` may vary over time.

`maxOnHeapStorageMemory` is used when:

* UnifiedMemoryManager is requested to xref:memory:UnifiedMemoryManager.adoc#acquireStorageMemory[acquireStorageMemory]

* BlockManager is xref:storage:BlockManager.adoc#maxOnHeapMemory[created]

* MemoryStore is requested for the xref:storage:MemoryStore.adoc#maxMemory[total amount of memory available]

* (legacy) StaticMemoryManager is xref:memory:StaticMemoryManager.adoc#maxOnHeapStorageMemory[created] and requested to xref:memory:StaticMemoryManager.adoc#acquireStorageMemory[acquireStorageMemory]

== [[releaseExecutionMemory]] `releaseExecutionMemory` Method

[source, scala]
----
releaseExecutionMemory(
  numBytes: Long,
  taskAttemptId: Long,
  memoryMode: MemoryMode): Unit
----

`releaseExecutionMemory`...FIXME

NOTE: `releaseExecutionMemory` is used when `TaskMemoryManager` is requested to xref:TaskMemoryManager.adoc#releaseExecutionMemory[releaseExecutionMemory] and xref:TaskMemoryManager.adoc#cleanUpAllAllocatedMemory[cleanUpAllAllocatedMemory]

== [[releaseAllExecutionMemoryForTask]] `releaseAllExecutionMemoryForTask` Method

[source, scala]
----
releaseAllExecutionMemoryForTask(taskAttemptId: Long): Long
----

`releaseAllExecutionMemoryForTask`...FIXME

NOTE: `releaseAllExecutionMemoryForTask` is used exclusively when `TaskRunner` is requested to xref:spark-Executor-TaskRunner.adoc#run[run] (and cleans up after itself).

== [[tungstenMemoryMode]] `tungstenMemoryMode` Flag

[source, scala]
----
tungstenMemoryMode: MemoryMode
----

`tungstenMemoryMode` returns `OFF_HEAP` only when the following are all met:

* xref:ROOT:configuration-properties.adoc#spark.memory.offHeap.enabled[spark.memory.offHeap.enabled] configuration property is enabled (it is not by default)

* xref:ROOT:configuration-properties.adoc#spark.memory.offHeap.size[spark.memory.offHeap.size] configuration property is greater than `0` (it is `0` by default)

* JVM supports unaligned memory access (aka *unaligned Unsafe*, i.e. `sun.misc.Unsafe` package is available and the underlying system has unaligned-access capability)

Otherwise, `tungstenMemoryMode` returns `ON_HEAP`.

NOTE: Given that xref:ROOT:configuration-properties.adoc#spark.memory.offHeap.enabled[spark.memory.offHeap.enabled] configuration property is disabled (`false`) by default and xref:ROOT:configuration-properties.adoc#spark.memory.offHeap.size[spark.memory.offHeap.size] configuration property is `0` by default, Spark seems to encourage using Tungsten memory allocated on the JVM heap (`ON_HEAP`).

NOTE: `tungstenMemoryMode` is a Scala `final val` and cannot be changed by custom <<implementations, MemoryManagers>>.

[NOTE]
====
`tungstenMemoryMode` is used when:

* `TaskMemoryManager` is xref:TaskMemoryManager.adoc#tungstenMemoryMode[created]

* MemoryManager is created (and initializes the <<pageSizeBytes, pageSizeBytes>> and <<tungstenMemoryAllocator, tungstenMemoryAllocator>> internal properties)

[source, scala]
----
storageMemoryUsed: Long
----

storageMemoryUsed gives the total of the memory used by the <<onHeapStorageMemoryPool, on-heap StorageMemoryPool>> and <<offHeapStorageMemoryPool, off-heap StorageMemoryPool>>.

NOTE: storageMemoryUsed is used when...FIXME
