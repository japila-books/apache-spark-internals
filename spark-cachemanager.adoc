== Cache Manager

*Cache Manager* in Spark is responsible for passing RDDs partition contents to link:spark-blockmanager.adoc[Block Manager] and making sure a node doesn't load two copies of link:spark-rdd.adoc[an RDD] at once.

It keeps reference to Block Manager.

CAUTION: FIXME Review the `CacheManager` class.

In the code, the current instance of Cache Manager is available under `SparkEnv.get.cacheManager`.
