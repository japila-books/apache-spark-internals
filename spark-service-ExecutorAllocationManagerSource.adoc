* `executors/numberExecutorsToAdd` which exposes link:spark-ExecutorAllocationManager.adoc#numExecutorsToAdd[numExecutorsToAdd].
* `executors/numberExecutorsPendingToRemove` which corresponds to the number of elements in link:spark-ExecutorAllocationManager.adoc#executorsPendingToRemove[executorsPendingToRemove].
* `executors/numberAllExecutors` which corresponds to the number of elements in link:spark-ExecutorAllocationManager.adoc#executorIds[executorIds].
* `executors/numberTargetExecutors` which is link:spark-ExecutorAllocationManager.adoc#numExecutorsTarget[numExecutorsTarget].
