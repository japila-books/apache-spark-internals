== ResultStage -- Final Stage in Job

A `ResultStage` is the final stage in a job that applies a function on one or many partitions of the target RDD to compute the result of an action.

The partitions are given as a collection of partition ids (`partitions`) and the function `func: (TaskContext, Iterator[_]) => _`.
