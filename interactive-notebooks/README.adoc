== Interactive Notebooks

This document aims at presenting and eventually supporting me to select the open-source web-based visualisation tool for http://spark.apache.org[Apache Spark] with http://www.scala-lang.org[Scala] 2.11 support.

=== Requirements

1. Support for Apache Spark 2.0
2. Support for Scala 2.11 (the default Scala version for Spark 2.0)
3. Web-based
4. Open Source with [ASL 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) or similar license
5. Notebook Sharing using GitHub
6. Active Development and Community (the number of commits per week and month, github, gitter)
7. Autocompletion

Optional Requirements:

1. Sharing SparkContext
