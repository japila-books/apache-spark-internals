# Access private members in Scala in Spark shell

If you ever wanted to use `private[spark]` members in Spark using the Scala programming language, e.g. toy with `org.apache.spark.scheduler.DAGScheduler` or similar, you will have to use the following trick in Spark shell - use `:paste -raw` as described in [REPL: support for package definition](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-5299).

Open `spark-shell` and execute `:paste -raw` that allows you to enter any valid Scala code, including `package`.

The following snippet shows how to access `private[spark]` member `DAGScheduler.RESUBMIT_TIMEOUT`:

```text
scala> :paste -raw
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

package org.apache.spark

object spark {
  def test = {
    import org.apache.spark.scheduler._
    println(DAGScheduler.RESUBMIT_TIMEOUT == 200)
  }
}

scala> spark.test
true

scala> sc.version
res0: String = 1.6.0-SNAPSHOT
```
