# TaskSetManager

`TaskSetManager` is a [Schedulable](Schedulable.md) that manages scheduling the tasks of a [TaskSet](#taskSet).

<figure markdown>
  ![TaskSetManager](../images/TaskSetManager-TaskSchedulerImpl-TaskSet.png)
</figure>

## Creating Instance

`TaskSetManager` takes the following to be created:

* <span id="sched"> [TaskSchedulerImpl](TaskSchedulerImpl.md)
* <span id="taskSet"> [TaskSet](TaskSet.md)
* [Number of Task Failures](#maxTaskFailures)
* <span id="healthTracker"> `HealthTracker`
* <span id="clock"> `Clock`

`TaskSetManager` is created when:

* `TaskSchedulerImpl` is requested to [create a TaskSetManager](TaskSchedulerImpl.md#createTaskSetManager)

---

While being created, `TaskSetManager` [requests the current epoch from `MapOutputTracker`](MapOutputTracker.md#getEpoch) and sets it on all tasks in the taskset.

!!! note
    `TaskSetManager` uses [TaskSchedulerImpl](#sched) to [access the current `MapOutputTracker`](TaskSchedulerImpl.md#mapOutputTracker).

`TaskSetManager` prints out the following DEBUG to the logs:

```text
Epoch for [taskSet]: [epoch]
```

`TaskSetManager` [adds the tasks as pending execution](#addPendingTask) (in reverse order from the highest partition to the lowest).

### Number of Task Failures { #maxTaskFailures }

`TaskSetManager` is given `maxTaskFailures` value that is how many times a [single task can fail](#handleFailedTask) before the whole [TaskSet](#taskSet) is [aborted](#abort).

Master URL | Number of Task Failures
-----------|------
 `local` | 1
 local-with-retries | `maxFailures`
 `local-cluster` | [spark.task.maxFailures](../configuration-properties.md#spark.task.maxFailures)
 Cluster Manager | [spark.task.maxFailures](../configuration-properties.md#spark.task.maxFailures)

## isBarrier { #isBarrier }

```scala
isBarrier: Boolean
```

`isBarrier` is enabled (`true`) when this `TaskSetManager` is created for a [TaskSet](#taskSet) with [barrier tasks](Task.md#isBarrier).

---

`isBarrier` is used when:

* `TaskSchedulerImpl` is requested to [resourceOfferSingleTaskSet](TaskSchedulerImpl.md#resourceOfferSingleTaskSet), [resourceOffers](TaskSchedulerImpl.md#resourceOffers)
* `TaskSetManager` is requested to [resourceOffer](#resourceOffer), [checkSpeculatableTasks](#checkSpeculatableTasks), [getLocalityWait](#getLocalityWait)

## resourceOffer { #resourceOffer }

```scala
resourceOffer(
  execId: String,
  host: String,
  maxLocality: TaskLocality.TaskLocality,
  taskCpus: Int = sched.CPUS_PER_TASK,
  taskResourceAssignments: Map[String, ResourceInformation] = Map.empty): (Option[TaskDescription], Boolean, Int)
```

`resourceOffer` [determines allowed locality level](#getAllowedLocalityLevel) for the given `TaskLocality` being anything but `NO_PREF`.

`resourceOffer` [dequeueTask](#dequeueTask) for the given `execId` and `host`, and the allowed locality level. This may or may not give a [TaskDescription](TaskDescription.md).

In the end, `resourceOffer` returns the `TaskDescription`, `hasScheduleDelayReject`, and the index of the dequeued task (if any).

---

`resourceOffer` returns a `(None, false, -1)` tuple when this `TaskSetManager` is [isZombie](#isZombie) or the offer (by the given `host` or `execId`) should be ignored (_excluded_).

---

`resourceOffer` is used when:

* `TaskSchedulerImpl` is requested to [resourceOfferSingleTaskSet](TaskSchedulerImpl.md#resourceOfferSingleTaskSet)

## Locality Wait { #getLocalityWait }

```scala
getLocalityWait(
  level: TaskLocality.TaskLocality): Long
```

`getLocalityWait` is `0` for [legacyLocalityWaitReset](#legacyLocalityWaitReset) and [isBarrier](#isBarrier) flags enabled.

`getLocalityWait` determines the value of locality wait based on the given `TaskLocality.TaskLocality`.

TaskLocality | Configuration Property
-------------|-----------------------
 `PROCESS_LOCAL` | [spark.locality.wait.process](../configuration-properties.md#LOCALITY_WAIT_PROCESS)
 `NODE_LOCAL` | [spark.locality.wait.node](../configuration-properties.md#LOCALITY_WAIT_NODE)
 `RACK_LOCAL` | [spark.locality.wait.rack](../configuration-properties.md#LOCALITY_WAIT_RACK)

Unless the value has been determined, `getLocalityWait` defaults to `0`.

!!! note
    `NO_PREF` and `ANY` task localities have no locality wait.

---

`getLocalityWait` is used when:

* `TaskSetManager` is [created](#localityWaits) and [recomputes locality preferences](#recomputeLocality)

## spark.driver.maxResultSize { #maxResultSize }

`TaskSetManager` uses [spark.driver.maxResultSize](../configuration-properties.md#spark.driver.maxResultSize) configuration property to [check available memory for more task results](#canFetchMoreResults).

## Recomputing Task Locality Preferences { #recomputeLocality }

```java
recomputeLocality(): Unit
```

If [zombie](#isZombie), `recomputeLocality` does nothing.

`recomputeLocality` recomputes [myLocalityLevels](#myLocalityLevels), [localityWaits](#localityWaits) and [currentLocalityIndex](#currentLocalityIndex) internal registries.

`recomputeLocality` [computes locality levels (for scheduled tasks)](#computeValidLocalityLevels) and saves the result in [myLocalityLevels](#myLocalityLevels) internal registry.

`recomputeLocality` computes [localityWaits](#localityWaits) by [determining the locality wait](#getLocalityWait) for every locality level in [myLocalityLevels](#myLocalityLevels).

`recomputeLocality` computes [currentLocalityIndex](#currentLocalityIndex) by [getLocalityIndex](#getLocalityIndex) with the previous locality level. If the current locality index is higher than the previous, `recomputeLocality` recalculates [currentLocalityIndex](#currentLocalityIndex).

---

`recomputeLocality` is used when:

* `TaskSetManager` is notified about status change in executors (i.e., [lost](#executorLost), [decommissioned](#executorDecommission), [added](#executorAdded))

## Zombie

A `TaskSetManager` is a **zombie** when all tasks in a taskset have completed successfully (regardless of the number of task attempts), or if the taskset has been [aborted](#abort).

While in zombie state, a `TaskSetManager` can launch no new tasks and responds with no `TaskDescription`s to [resourceOffers](#resourceOffer).

A `TaskSetManager` remains in the zombie state until all tasks have finished running, i.e. to continue to track and account for the running tasks.

## Computing Locality Levels (for Scheduled Tasks) { #computeValidLocalityLevels }

```scala
computeValidLocalityLevels(): Array[TaskLocality.TaskLocality]
```

`computeValidLocalityLevels` computes valid locality levels for tasks that were registered in corresponding registries per locality level.

!!! note
    [TaskLocality](TaskSchedulerImpl.md) is a locality preference of a task and can be the most localized `PROCESS_LOCAL`, `NODE_LOCAL` through `NO_PREF` and `RACK_LOCAL` to `ANY`.

For every pending task (in [pendingTasks](#pendingTasks) registry), `computeValidLocalityLevels` requests the [TaskSchedulerImpl](#sched) for acceptable `TaskLocality`ies:

* For every executor, `computeValidLocalityLevels` requests the [TaskSchedulerImpl](#sched) to [isExecutorAlive](TaskSchedulerImpl.md#isExecutorAlive) and adds `PROCESS_LOCAL`
* For every host, `computeValidLocalityLevels` requests the [TaskSchedulerImpl](#sched) to [hasExecutorsAliveOnHost](TaskSchedulerImpl.md#hasExecutorsAliveOnHost) and adds `NODE_LOCAL`
* For any pending tasks with no locality preference, `computeValidLocalityLevels` adds `NO_PREF`
* For every rack, `computeValidLocalityLevels` requests the [TaskSchedulerImpl](#sched) to [hasHostAliveOnRack](TaskSchedulerImpl.md#hasHostAliveOnRack) and adds `RACK_LOCAL`

`computeValidLocalityLevels` always registers `ANY` task locality level.

In the end, `computeValidLocalityLevels` prints out the following DEBUG message to the logs:

```text
Valid locality levels for [taskSet]: [comma-separated levels]
```

---

`computeValidLocalityLevels` is used when:

* `TaskSetManager` is [created](#myLocalityLevels) and to [recomputeLocality](#recomputeLocality)

## executorAdded { #executorAdded }

```scala
executorAdded(): Unit
```

`executorAdded` [recomputeLocality](#recomputeLocality).

---

`executorAdded` is used when:

* `TaskSchedulerImpl` is requested to [handle resource offers](TaskSchedulerImpl.md#resourceOffers)

## prepareLaunchingTask { #prepareLaunchingTask }

```scala
prepareLaunchingTask(
  execId: String,
  host: String,
  index: Int,
  taskLocality: TaskLocality.Value,
  speculative: Boolean,
  taskCpus: Int,
  taskResourceAssignments: Map[String, ResourceInformation],
  launchTime: Long): TaskDescription
```

??? note "taskResourceAssignments"
    `taskResourceAssignments` are the resources that are passed in to [resourceOffer](#resourceOffer).

`prepareLaunchingTask`...FIXME

---

`prepareLaunchingTask` is used when:

* `TaskSchedulerImpl` is requested to [resourceOffers](TaskSchedulerImpl.md#resourceOffers)
* `TaskSetManager` is requested to [resourceOffers](#resourceOffers)

## Serialized Task Size Threshold { #TASK_SIZE_TO_WARN_KIB }

`TaskSetManager` object defines `TASK_SIZE_TO_WARN_KIB` value as the threshold to warn a user if any stages contain a task that has a serialized size greater than `1000` kB.

### DAGScheduler { #TASK_SIZE_TO_WARN_KIB-DAGScheduler }

`DAGScheduler` can print out the following WARN message to the logs when requested to [submitMissingTasks](DAGScheduler.md#submitMissingTasks):

```text
Broadcasting large task binary with size [taskBinaryBytes] [siByteSuffix]
```

### TaskSetManager { #TASK_SIZE_TO_WARN_KIB-TaskSetManager }

`TaskSetManager` can print out the following WARN message to the logs when requested to [prepareLaunchingTask](#prepareLaunchingTask):

```text
Stage [stageId] contains a task of very large size ([serializedTask] KiB).
The maximum recommended task size is 1000 KiB.
```

## Demo

Enable `DEBUG` logging level for `org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskSchedulerImpl` (or `org.apache.spark.scheduler.cluster.YarnScheduler` for YARN) and `org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskSetManager` and execute the following two-stage job to see their low-level innerworkings.

A cluster manager is recommended since it gives more task localization choices (with YARN additionally supporting rack localization).

## Review Me

`TaskSetManager` is <<creating-instance, created>> exclusively when `TaskSchedulerImpl` is requested to TaskSchedulerImpl.md#createTaskSetManager[create one] (when submitting tasks for a given `TaskSet`).

When <<creating-instance, created>> with a given <<taskSet, TaskSet>>, `TaskSetManager` <<addPendingTask, registers all the tasks as pending execution>>.

`TaskSetManager` is notified when a task (from the `TaskSet` it manages) finishes -- <<handleSuccessfulTask, sucessfully>> or due to a <<handleFailedTask, failure>> (in task execution or <<executorLost, an executor being lost>>).

`TaskSetManager` uses <<maxTaskFailures, maxTaskFailures>> to control how many times a <<handleFailedTask, single task can fail>> before an <<abort, entire `TaskSet` gets aborted>> that can take the following values:

* `1` for local/spark-local.md[`local` run mode]
* `maxFailures` in local/spark-local.md#local-with-retries[Spark local-with-retries] (i.e. `local[N, maxFailures]`)
* configuration-properties.md#spark.task.maxFailures[spark.task.maxFailures] configuration property for local/spark-local.md[Spark local-cluster] and spark-cluster.md[Spark clustered] (using Spark Standalone, Mesos and YARN)

The responsibilities of a `TaskSetManager` include:

* <<scheduling-tasks, Scheduling the tasks in a taskset>>
* <<task-retries, Retrying tasks on failure>>
* <<locality-aware-scheduling, Locality-aware scheduling via delay scheduling>>

[[internal-registries]]
.TaskSetManager's Internal Properties (e.g. Registries, Counters and Flags)
[cols="1,3",options="header",width="100%"]
|===
| Name
| Description

| [[allPendingTasks]] `allPendingTasks`
| Indices of all the pending tasks to execute (regardless of their localization preferences).

Updated with an task index when `TaskSetManager` <<addPendingTask, registers a task as pending execution (per preferred locations)>>.

| [[calculatedTasks]] `calculatedTasks`
| The number of the tasks that have already completed execution.

Starts from `0` when a <<creating-instance, `TaskSetManager` is created>> and is only incremented when the <<canFetchMoreResults, `TaskSetManager` checks that there is enough memory to fetch a task result>>.

| [[copiesRunning]] `copiesRunning`
| The number of task copies currently running per task (index in its task set).

The number of task copies of a task is increased when <<resourceOffer, finds a task for execution (given resource offer)>> or <<checkSpeculatableTasks, checking for speculatable tasks>> and decreased when <<handleFailedTask, a task fails>> or <<executorLost, an executor is lost>> (for a shuffle map stage and no external shuffle service).

| [[currentLocalityIndex]] `currentLocalityIndex`
|

| [[epoch]] `epoch`
| Current scheduler:MapOutputTracker.md#getEpoch[map output tracker epoch].

| [[failedExecutors]] `failedExecutors`
| Lookup table of [TaskInfo](TaskInfo.md) indices that failed to executor ids and the time of the failure.

Used in <<handleFailedTask, handleFailedTask>>.

| [[myLocalityLevels]] `myLocalityLevels`
| scheduler:TaskSchedulerImpl.md#TaskLocality[`TaskLocality` locality preferences] of the pending tasks in the <<taskSet, TaskSet>> ranging from `PROCESS_LOCAL` through `NODE_LOCAL`, `NO_PREF`, and `RACK_LOCAL` to `ANY`.

NOTE: `myLocalityLevels` may contain only a few of all the available `TaskLocality` preferences with `ANY` as a mandatory task locality preference.

<<computeValidLocalityLevels, Set>> immediately when <<creating-instance, `TaskSetManager` is created>>.

<<recomputeLocality, Recomputed>> every change in the status of executors.

| [[numFailures]] `numFailures`
| Array of the number of task failures per <<tasks, task>>.

Incremented when `TaskSetManager` <<handleFailedTask, handles a task failure>> and immediatelly checked if above <<maxTaskFailures, acceptable number of task failures>>.

| [[numTasks]] `numTasks`
| Number of <<tasks, tasks>> to compute.

| [[pendingTasksForExecutor]] `pendingTasksForExecutor`
| Lookup table of the indices of tasks pending execution per executor.

Updated with an task index and executor when `TaskSetManager` <<addPendingTask, registers a task as pending execution (per preferred locations)>> (and the location is a `ExecutorCacheTaskLocation` or `HDFSCacheTaskLocation`).

| [[pendingTasksForHost]] `pendingTasksForHost`
| Lookup table of the indices of tasks pending execution per host.

Updated with an task index and host when `TaskSetManager` <<addPendingTask, registers a task as pending execution (per preferred locations)>>.

| [[pendingTasksForRack]] `pendingTasksForRack`
| Lookup table of the indices of tasks pending execution per rack.

Updated with an task index and rack when `TaskSetManager` <<addPendingTask, registers a task as pending execution (per preferred locations)>>.

| [[pendingTasksWithNoPrefs]] `pendingTasksWithNoPrefs`
| Lookup table of the indices of tasks pending execution with no location preferences.

Updated with an task index when `TaskSetManager` <<addPendingTask, registers a task as pending execution (per preferred locations)>>.

| [[runningTasksSet]] `runningTasksSet`
| Collection of running tasks that a `TaskSetManager` manages.

Used to implement <<runningTasks, runningTasks>> (that is simply the size of `runningTasksSet` but a required part of any spark-scheduler-Schedulable.md#contract[Schedulable]). `runningTasksSet` is expanded when <<addRunningTask, registering a running task>> and shrinked when <<removeRunningTask, unregistering a running task>>.

Used in scheduler:TaskSchedulerImpl.md#cancelTasks[`TaskSchedulerImpl` to cancel tasks].

| [[stageId]] `stageId`
| The stage's id a `TaskSetManager` runs for.

Set when <<creating-instance, `TaskSetManager` is created>>.

NOTE: `stageId` is part of spark-scheduler-Schedulable.md#contract[Schedulable contract].

| [[successful]] `successful`
| Status of <<tasks, tasks>> (with a boolean flag, i.e. `true` or `false`, per task).

All tasks start with their flags disabled, i.e. `false`, when <<creating-instance, `TaskSetManager` is created>>.

The flag for a task is turned on, i.e. `true`, when a task finishes <<handleSuccessfulTask, successfully>> but also <<handleFailedTask, with a failure>>.

A flag is explicitly turned off only for <<executorLost, `ShuffleMapTask` tasks when their executor is lost>>.

| [[taskAttempts]] `taskAttempts`
| Registry of [TaskInfo](TaskInfo.md)s per every task attempt per task.

| [[taskInfos]] `taskInfos`
| Registry of [TaskInfo](TaskInfo.md)s per task id.

Updated with the task (id) and the corresponding `TaskInfo` when `TaskSetManager` <<resourceOffer, finds a task for execution (given resource offer)>>.

NOTE: It _appears_ that the entires stay forever, i.e. are never removed (perhaps because the maintenance overhead is not needed given a `TaskSetManager` is a short-lived entity).

| [[tasks]] `tasks`
| Lookup table of scheduler:Task.md[Tasks] (per partition id) to schedule execution of.

NOTE: The tasks all belong to a single <<taskSet, TaskSet>> that was given when <<creating-instance, `TaskSetManager` was created>> (which actually represent a single scheduler:Stage.md[Stage]).

| [[tasksSuccessful]] `tasksSuccessful`
|

| [[totalResultSize]] `totalResultSize`
| The current total size of the result of all the tasks that have finished.

Starts from `0` when <<creating-instance, `TaskSetManager` is created>>.

Only increased with the size of a task result whenever a `TaskSetManager` <<canFetchMoreResults, checks that there is enough memory to fetch the task result>>.

=== [[abortIfCompletelyBlacklisted]] `abortIfCompletelyBlacklisted` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
abortIfCompletelyBlacklisted(
  hostToExecutors: HashMap[String, HashSet[String]]): Unit
----

`abortIfCompletelyBlacklisted`...FIXME

NOTE: `abortIfCompletelyBlacklisted` is used exclusively when `TaskSchedulerImpl` is requested to scheduler:TaskSchedulerImpl.md#resourceOffers[resourceOffers].

=== [[schedulable]] TaskSetManager is Schedulable

`TaskSetManager` is a spark-scheduler-Schedulable.md[Schedulable] with the following implementation:

* `name` is `TaskSet_[taskSet.stageId.toString]`
* no `parent` is ever assigned, i.e. it is always `null`.
+
It means that it can only be a leaf in the tree of Schedulables (with spark-scheduler-Pool.md[Pools] being the nodes).

* `schedulingMode` always returns `SchedulingMode.NONE` (since there is nothing to schedule).
* `weight` is always `1`.
* `minShare` is always `0`.
* `runningTasks` is the number of running tasks in the internal  `runningTasksSet`.
* `priority` is the priority of the owned scheduler:TaskSet.md[TaskSet] (using `taskSet.priority`).
* `stageId` is the stage id of the owned scheduler:TaskSet.md[TaskSet] (using `taskSet.stageId`).

* `schedulableQueue` returns no queue, i.e. `null`.
* `addSchedulable` and `removeSchedulable` do nothing.
* `getSchedulableByName` always returns `null`.

* `getSortedTaskSetQueue` returns a one-element collection with the sole element being itself.

* <<executorLost, executorLost>>
* <<checkSpeculatableTasks, checkSpeculatableTasks>>

=== [[handleTaskGettingResult]] Marking Task As Fetching Indirect Result -- `handleTaskGettingResult` Method

[source, scala]
----
handleTaskGettingResult(tid: Long): Unit
----

`handleTaskGettingResult` finds [TaskInfo](TaskInfo.md) for `tid` task in <<taskInfos, taskInfos>> internal registry and marks it as fetching indirect task result. It then scheduler:DAGScheduler.md#taskGettingResult[notifies `DAGScheduler`].

NOTE: `handleTaskGettingResult` is executed when scheduler:TaskSchedulerImpl.md#handleTaskGettingResult[`TaskSchedulerImpl` is notified about fetching indirect task result].

=== [[addRunningTask]] Registering Running Task -- `addRunningTask` Method

[source, scala]
----
addRunningTask(tid: Long): Unit
----

`addRunningTask` adds `tid` to <<runningTasksSet, runningTasksSet>> internal registry and spark-scheduler-Pool.md#increaseRunningTasks[requests the `parent` pool to increase the number of running tasks] (if defined).

=== [[removeRunningTask]] Unregistering Running Task -- `removeRunningTask` Method

[source, scala]
----
removeRunningTask(tid: Long): Unit
----

`removeRunningTask` removes `tid` from <<runningTasksSet, runningTasksSet>> internal registry and spark-scheduler-Pool.md#decreaseRunningTasks[requests the `parent` pool to decrease the number of running task] (if defined).

=== [[checkSpeculatableTasks]] Checking Speculatable Tasks -- `checkSpeculatableTasks` Method

[source, scala]
----
checkSpeculatableTasks(minTimeToSpeculation: Int): Boolean
----

NOTE: `checkSpeculatableTasks` is part of the spark-scheduler-Schedulable.md#contract[Schedulable Contract].

`checkSpeculatableTasks` checks whether there are speculatable tasks in a `TaskSet`.

NOTE: `checkSpeculatableTasks` is called when for speculative-execution-of-tasks.md[].

If the TaskSetManager is <<zombie-state, zombie>> or has a single task in TaskSet, it assumes no speculatable tasks.

The method goes on with the assumption of no speculatable tasks by default.

It computes the minimum number of finished tasks for speculation (as configuration-properties.md#spark.speculation.quantile[spark.speculation.quantile] of all the finished tasks).

You should see the DEBUG message in the logs:

```
DEBUG Checking for speculative tasks: minFinished = [minFinishedForSpeculation]
```

It then checks whether the number is equal or greater than the number of tasks completed successfully (using `tasksSuccessful`).

Having done that, it computes the median duration of all the successfully completed tasks (using <<taskInfos, `taskInfos` internal registry>>) and task length threshold using the median duration multiplied by configuration-properties.md#spark.speculation.multiplier[spark.speculation.multiplier] that has to be equal or less than `100`.

You should see the DEBUG message in the logs:

```
DEBUG Task length threshold for speculation: [threshold]
```

For each task (using <<taskInfos, `taskInfos` internal registry>>) that is not marked as successful yet (using `successful`) for which there is only one copy running (using `copiesRunning`) and the task takes more time than the calculated threshold, but it was not in `speculatableTasks` it is assumed *speculatable*.

You should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO Marking task [index] in stage [taskSet.id] (on [info.host]) as speculatable because it ran more than [threshold] ms
```

The task gets added to the internal `speculatableTasks` collection. The method responds positively.

=== [[getAllowedLocalityLevel]] `getAllowedLocalityLevel` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
getAllowedLocalityLevel(curTime: Long): TaskLocality.TaskLocality
----

`getAllowedLocalityLevel`...FIXME

NOTE: `getAllowedLocalityLevel` is used exclusively when `TaskSetManager` is requested to <<resourceOffer, find a task for execution (given a resource offer)>>.

=== [[resourceOffer]] Finding Task For Execution (Given Resource Offer) -- `resourceOffer` Method

[source, scala]
----
resourceOffer(
  execId: String,
  host: String,
  maxLocality: TaskLocality): Option[TaskDescription]
----

(only if <<taskSetBlacklistHelperOpt, TaskSetBlacklist>> is defined) `resourceOffer` requests `TaskSetBlacklist` to check if the input spark-scheduler-TaskSetBlacklist.md#isExecutorBlacklistedForTaskSet[`execId` executor] or spark-scheduler-TaskSetBlacklist.md#isNodeBlacklistedForTaskSet[`host` node] are blacklisted.

When `TaskSetManager` is a <<zombie-state, zombie>> or the resource offer (as executor and host) is blacklisted, `resourceOffer` finds no tasks to execute (and returns no [TaskDescription](TaskDescription.md)).

NOTE: `resourceOffer` finds a task to schedule for a resource offer when neither `TaskSetManager` is a <<zombie-state, zombie>> nor the resource offer is blacklisted.

`resourceOffer` calculates the allowed task locality for task selection. When the input `maxLocality` is not `NO_PREF` task locality, `resourceOffer` <<getAllowedLocalityLevel, getAllowedLocalityLevel>> (for the current time) and sets it as the current task locality if more localized (specific).

NOTE: scheduler:TaskSchedulerImpl.md[TaskLocality] can be the most localized `PROCESS_LOCAL`, `NODE_LOCAL` through `NO_PREF` and `RACK_LOCAL` to `ANY`.

`resourceOffer` <<dequeueTask, dequeues a task tor execution (given locality information)>>.

If a task (index) is found, `resourceOffer` takes the scheduler:Task.md[Task] (from <<tasks, tasks>> registry).

`resourceOffer` scheduler:TaskSchedulerImpl.md#newTaskId[requests `TaskSchedulerImpl` for the id for the new task].

`resourceOffer` increments the <<copiesRunning, number of the copies of the task that are currently running>> and finds the task attempt number (as the size of <<taskAttempts, taskAttempts>> entries for the task index).

`resourceOffer` creates a [TaskInfo](TaskInfo.md) that is then registered in <<taskInfos, taskInfos>> and <<taskAttempts, taskAttempts>>.

If the maximum acceptable task locality is not `NO_PREF`, `resourceOffer` <<getLocalityIndex, getLocalityIndex>> (using the task's locality) and records it as <<currentLocalityIndex, currentLocalityIndex>> with the current time as <<lastLaunchTime, lastLaunchTime>>.

`resourceOffer` serializes the task.

NOTE: `resourceOffer` uses core:SparkEnv.md#closureSerializer[`SparkEnv` to access the closure `Serializer`] and serializer:Serializer.md#newInstance[create an instance thereof].

If the task serialization fails, you should see the following ERROR message in the logs:

```text
Failed to serialize task [taskId], not attempting to retry it.
```

`resourceOffer` <<abort, aborts the `TaskSet`>> with the following message and reports a `TaskNotSerializableException`.

```text
Failed to serialize task [taskId], not attempting to retry it. Exception during serialization: [exception]
```

`resourceOffer` checks the size of the serialized task. If it is greater than `100` kB, you should see the following WARN message in the logs:

```text
Stage [id] contains a task of very large size ([size] KB). The maximum recommended task size is 100 KB.
```

NOTE: The size of the serializable task, i.e. `100` kB, is not configurable.

If however the serialization went well and the size is fine too, `resourceOffer` <<addRunningTask, registers the task as running>>.

You should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```text
Starting [name] (TID [id], [host], executor [id], partition [id], [taskLocality], [size] bytes)
```

For example:

```text
Starting task 1.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 1, localhost, partition 1, PROCESS_LOCAL, 2054 bytes)
```

`resourceOffer` scheduler:DAGScheduler.md#taskStarted[notifies `DAGScheduler` that the task has been started].

IMPORTANT: This is the moment when `TaskSetManager` informs `DAGScheduler` that a task has started.

NOTE: `resourceOffer` is used exclusively when `TaskSchedulerImpl` is requested to scheduler:TaskSchedulerImpl.md#resourceOfferSingleTaskSet[resourceOfferSingleTaskSet].

=== [[dequeueTask]] Dequeueing Task For Execution (Given Locality Information) -- `dequeueTask` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
dequeueTask(execId: String, host: String, maxLocality: TaskLocality): Option[(Int, TaskLocality, Boolean)]
----

`dequeueTask` tries to <<dequeueTaskFromList, find the higest task index>> (meeting localization requirements) using <<getPendingTasksForExecutor, tasks (indices) registered for execution on `execId` executor>>. If a task is found, `dequeueTask` returns its index, `PROCESS_LOCAL` task locality and the speculative marker disabled.

`dequeueTask` then goes over all the possible scheduler:TaskSchedulerImpl.md#TaskLocality[task localities] and checks what locality is allowed given the input `maxLocality`.

`dequeueTask` checks out `NODE_LOCAL`, `NO_PREF`, `RACK_LOCAL` and `ANY` in that order.

For `NODE_LOCAL` `dequeueTask` tries to <<dequeueTaskFromList, find the higest task index>> (meeting localization requirements) using <<getPendingTasksForHost, tasks (indices) registered for execution on `host` host>> and if found returns its index, `NODE_LOCAL` task locality and the speculative marker disabled.

For `NO_PREF` `dequeueTask` tries to <<dequeueTaskFromList, find the higest task index>> (meeting localization requirements) using <<pendingTasksWithNoPrefs, pendingTasksWithNoPrefs>> internal registry and if found returns its index, `PROCESS_LOCAL` task locality and the speculative marker disabled.

NOTE: For `NO_PREF` the task locality is `PROCESS_LOCAL`.

For `RACK_LOCAL` `dequeueTask` scheduler:TaskSchedulerImpl.md#getRackForHost[finds the rack for the input `host`] and if available tries to <<dequeueTaskFromList, find the higest task index>> (meeting localization requirements) using <<getPendingTasksForRack, tasks (indices) registered for execution on the rack>>. If a task is found, `dequeueTask` returns its index, `RACK_LOCAL` task locality and the speculative marker disabled.

For `ANY` `dequeueTask` tries to <<dequeueTaskFromList, find the higest task index>> (meeting localization requirements) using <<allPendingTasks, allPendingTasks>> internal registry and if found returns its index, `ANY` task locality and the speculative marker disabled.

In the end, when no task could be found, `dequeueTask` <<dequeueSpeculativeTask, dequeueSpeculativeTask>> and if found returns its index, locality and the speculative marker enabled.

NOTE: The speculative marker is enabled for a task only when `dequeueTask` did not manage to find a task for the available task localities and did find a speculative task.

NOTE: `dequeueTask` is used exclusively when `TaskSetManager` is requested to <<resourceOffer, find a task for execution (given a resource offer)>>.

=== [[dequeueTaskFromList]] Finding Higest Task Index (Not Blacklisted, With No Copies Running and Not Completed Already) -- `dequeueTaskFromList` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
dequeueTaskFromList(
  execId: String,
  host: String,
  list: ArrayBuffer[Int]): Option[Int]
----

`dequeueTaskFromList` takes task indices from the input `list` backwards (from the last to the first entry). For every index `dequeueTaskFromList` checks if it is not <<isTaskBlacklistedOnExecOrNode, blacklisted on the input `execId` executor and `host`>> and if not, checks that:

* <<copiesRunning, number of the copies of the task currently running>> is `0`

* the task has not been marked as <<successful, completed>>

If so, `dequeueTaskFromList` returns the task index.

If `dequeueTaskFromList` has checked all the indices and no index has passed the checks, `dequeueTaskFromList` returns `None` (to indicate that no index has met the requirements).

NOTE: `dequeueTaskFromList` is used exclusively when `TaskSetManager` is requested to <<dequeueTask, dequeue a task for execution (given a locality information)>>.

=== [[getPendingTasksForExecutor]] Finding Tasks (Indices) Registered For Execution on Executor -- `getPendingTasksForExecutor` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
getPendingTasksForExecutor(executorId: String): ArrayBuffer[Int]
----

`getPendingTasksForExecutor` finds pending tasks (indices) registered for execution on the input `executorId` executor (in <<pendingTasksForExecutor, pendingTasksForExecutor>> internal registry).

NOTE: `getPendingTasksForExecutor` may find no matching tasks and return an empty collection.

NOTE: `getPendingTasksForExecutor` is used exclusively when `TaskSetManager` is requested to <<dequeueTask, dequeue a task for execution (given a locality information)>>.

=== [[getPendingTasksForHost]] Finding Tasks (Indices) Registered For Execution on Host -- `getPendingTasksForHost` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
getPendingTasksForHost(host: String): ArrayBuffer[Int]
----

`getPendingTasksForHost` finds pending tasks (indices) registered for execution on the input `host` host (in <<pendingTasksForHost, pendingTasksForHost>> internal registry).

NOTE: `getPendingTasksForHost` may find no matching tasks and return an empty collection.

NOTE: `getPendingTasksForHost` is used exclusively when `TaskSetManager` is requested to <<dequeueTask, dequeue a task for execution (given a locality information)>>.

=== [[getPendingTasksForRack]] Finding Tasks (Indices) Registered For Execution on Rack -- `getPendingTasksForRack` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
getPendingTasksForRack(rack: String): ArrayBuffer[Int]
----

`getPendingTasksForRack` finds pending tasks (indices) registered for execution on the input `rack` rack (in <<pendingTasksForRack, pendingTasksForRack>> internal registry).

NOTE: `getPendingTasksForRack` may find no matching tasks and return an empty collection.

NOTE: `getPendingTasksForRack` is used exclusively when `TaskSetManager` is requested to <<dequeueTask, dequeue a task for execution (given a locality information)>>.

=== [[scheduling-tasks]] Scheduling Tasks in TaskSet

CAUTION: FIXME

For each submitted <<taskset, TaskSet>>, a new `TaskSetManager` is created. The TaskSetManager completely and exclusively owns a TaskSet submitted for execution.

CAUTION: FIXME A picture with `TaskSetManager` owning TaskSet

CAUTION: FIXME What component knows about TaskSet and TaskSetManager. Isn't it that TaskSets are *created* by  DAGScheduler while TaskSetManager is used by TaskSchedulerImpl only?

TaskSetManager keeps track of the tasks pending execution per executor, host, rack or with no locality preferences.

=== [[locality-aware-scheduling]] Locality-Aware Scheduling aka Delay Scheduling

TaskSetManager computes locality levels for the TaskSet for delay scheduling. While computing you should see the following DEBUG in the logs:

```
DEBUG Valid locality levels for [taskSet]:  [levels]
```

CAUTION: FIXME What's delay scheduling?

=== [[events]] Events

Once a task has finished, `TaskSetManager` informs scheduler:DAGScheduler.md#taskEnded[DAGScheduler].

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[handleSuccessfulTask]] Recording Successful Task And Notifying DAGScheduler -- `handleSuccessfulTask` Method

[source, scala]
----
handleSuccessfulTask(
  tid: Long,
  result: DirectTaskResult[_]): Unit
----

`handleSuccessfulTask` records the `tid` task as finished, scheduler:DAGScheduler.md#taskEnded[notifies the `DAGScheduler` that the task has ended] and <<maybeFinishTaskSet, attempts to mark the `TaskSet` finished>>.

NOTE: `handleSuccessfulTask` is executed after scheduler:TaskSchedulerImpl.md#handleSuccessfulTask[`TaskSchedulerImpl` has been informed that `tid` task finished successfully (and the task result was deserialized)].

Internally, `handleSuccessfulTask` finds [TaskInfo](TaskInfo.md) (in <<taskInfos, taskInfos>> internal registry) and marks it as `FINISHED`.

It then removes `tid` task from <<runningTasksSet, runningTasksSet>> internal registry.

`handleSuccessfulTask` scheduler:DAGScheduler.md#taskEnded[notifies `DAGScheduler` that `tid` task ended successfully] (with the `Task` object from <<tasks, tasks>> internal registry and the result as `Success`).

At this point, `handleSuccessfulTask` finds the other <<taskAttempts, running task attempts>> of `tid` task and scheduler:SchedulerBackend.md#killTask[requests `SchedulerBackend` to kill them] (since they are no longer necessary now when at least one task attempt has completed successfully). You should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```text
Killing attempt [attemptNumber] for task [id] in stage [id] (TID [id]) on [host] as the attempt [attemptNumber] succeeded on [host]
```

CAUTION: FIXME Review `taskAttempts`

If `tid` has _not_ yet been recorded as <<successful, successful>>, `handleSuccessfulTask` increases <<tasksSuccessful, tasksSuccessful>> counter. You should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```text
Finished task [id] in stage [id] (TID [taskId]) in [duration] ms on [host] (executor [executorId]) ([tasksSuccessful]/[numTasks])
```

`tid` task is marked as <<successful, successful>>. If the number of task that have finished successfully is exactly the number of the tasks to execute (in the `TaskSet`), the `TaskSetManager` becomes a <<isZombie, zombie>>.

If `tid` task was already recorded as <<successful, successful>>, you should _merely_ see the following INFO message in the logs:

```text
Ignoring task-finished event for [id] in stage [id] because task [index] has already completed successfully
```

Ultimately, `handleSuccessfulTask` <<maybeFinishTaskSet, attempts to mark the `TaskSet` finished>>.

NOTE: `handleSuccessfulTask` is used exclusively when `TaskSchedulerImpl` is requested to scheduler:TaskSchedulerImpl.md#handleSuccessfulTask[handleSuccessfulTask].

=== [[maybeFinishTaskSet]] Attempting to Mark TaskSet Finished -- `maybeFinishTaskSet` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
maybeFinishTaskSet(): Unit
----

`maybeFinishTaskSet` scheduler:TaskSchedulerImpl.md#taskSetFinished[notifies `TaskSchedulerImpl` that a `TaskSet` has finished] when there are no other <<runningTasksSet, running tasks>> and the <<isZombie, TaskSetManager is not in zombie state>>.

=== [[task-retries]] Retrying Tasks on Failure

CAUTION: FIXME

Up to configuration-properties.md#spark.task.maxFailures[spark.task.maxFailures] attempts

=== Task retries and `spark.task.maxFailures`

When you start Spark program you set up configuration-properties.md#spark.task.maxFailures[spark.task.maxFailures] for the number of failures that are acceptable until `TaskSetManager` gives up and marks a job failed.

TIP: In Spark shell with local master, configuration-properties.md#spark.task.maxFailures[spark.task.maxFailures] is fixed to `1` and you need to use local/spark-local.md[local-with-retries master] to change it to some other value.

In the following example, you are going to execute a job with two partitions and keep one failing at all times (by throwing an exception). The aim is to learn the behavior of retrying task execution in a stage in TaskSet. You will only look at a single task execution, namely `0.0`.

=== [[abort]] Aborting TaskSet -- `abort` Method

[source, scala]
----
abort(
  message: String,
  exception: Option[Throwable] = None): Unit
----

`abort` informs scheduler:DAGScheduler.md#taskSetFailed[`DAGScheduler` that the `TaskSet` has been aborted].

CAUTION: FIXME image with DAGScheduler call

The TaskSetManager enters <<zombie-state, zombie state>>.

In the end, `abort` <<maybeFinishTaskSet, attempts to mark the `TaskSet` finished>>.

`abort` is used when:

* `TaskResultGetter` is requested to scheduler:TaskResultGetter.md#enqueueSuccessfulTask[enqueueSuccessfulTask] (that has failed)

* `TaskSchedulerImpl` is requested to scheduler:TaskSchedulerImpl.md#cancelTasks[cancelTasks] and scheduler:TaskSchedulerImpl.md#error[error]

* `TaskSetManager` is requested to <<resourceOffer, resourceOffer>>, <<abortIfCompletelyBlacklisted, abortIfCompletelyBlacklisted>>, <<canFetchMoreResults, canFetchMoreResults>>, and <<handleFailedTask, handleFailedTask>>

* `DriverEndpoint` is requested to [launch tasks on executors](DriverEndpoint.md#launchTasks)

=== [[handleFailedTask]] Getting Notified that Task Failed -- `handleFailedTask` Method

[source, scala]
----
handleFailedTask(
  tid: Long,
  state: TaskState,
  reason: TaskFailedReason): Unit
----

`handleFailedTask` finds [TaskInfo](TaskInfo.md) of `tid` task in <<taskInfos, taskInfos>> internal registry and simply quits if the task is already marked as failed or killed.

.TaskSetManager Gets Notified that Task Has Failed
image::TaskSetManager-handleFailedTask.png[align="center"]

NOTE: `handleFailedTask` is executed after TaskSchedulerImpl.md#handleFailedTask[`TaskSchedulerImpl` has been informed that `tid` task failed] or <<executorLost, an executor was lost>>. In either case, tasks could not finish successfully or could not report their status back.

`handleFailedTask` <<removeRunningTask, unregisters `tid` task from the internal registry of running tasks>> and then [marks the corresponding `TaskInfo` as finished](TaskInfo.md#markFinished) (passing in the input `state`).

`handleFailedTask` decrements the number of the running copies of `tid` task (in <<copiesRunning, copiesRunning>> internal registry).

NOTE: With speculative-execution-of-tasks.md[] enabled, there can be many copies of a task running simultaneuosly.

`handleFailedTask` uses the following pattern as the reason of the failure:

```
Lost task [id] in stage [taskSetId] (TID [tid], [host], executor [executorId]): [reason]
```

`handleFailedTask` then calculates the failure exception per the input `reason` (follow the links for more details):

* <<handleFailedTask-FetchFailed, FetchFailed>>
* <<handleFailedTask-ExceptionFailure, ExceptionFailure>>
* <<handleFailedTask-ExecutorLostFailure, ExecutorLostFailure>>
* <<handleFailedTask-TaskFailedReason, other TaskFailedReasons>>

NOTE: Description of how the final failure exception is "computed" was moved to respective sections below to make the reading slightly more pleasant and comprehensible.

`handleFailedTask` DAGScheduler.md#taskEnded[informs `DAGScheduler` that `tid` task has ended] (passing on the `Task` instance from <<tasks, tasks>> internal registry, the input `reason`, `null` result, calculated `accumUpdates` per failure, and the [TaskInfo](TaskInfo.md)).

IMPORTANT: This is the moment when `TaskSetManager` informs `DAGScheduler` that a task has ended.

If `tid` task has already been marked as completed (in <<successful, successful>> internal registry) you should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```text
Task [id] in stage [id] (TID [tid]) failed, but the task will not be re-executed (either because the task failed with a shuffle data fetch failure, so the previous stage needs to be re-run, or because a different copy of the task has already succeeded).
```

TIP: Read up on speculative-execution-of-tasks.md[] to find out why a single task could be executed multiple times.

If however `tid` task was not recorded as <<successful, completed>>, `handleFailedTask` <<addPendingTask, records it as pending>>.

If the `TaskSetManager` is not a <<zombie-state, zombie>> and the task failed `reason` should be counted towards the maximum number of times the task is allowed to fail before the stage is aborted (i.e. `TaskFailedReason.countTowardsTaskFailures` attribute is enabled), the optional spark-scheduler-TaskSetBlacklist.md#updateBlacklistForFailedTask[`TaskSetBlacklist` is notified] (passing on the host, executor and the task's index). `handleFailedTask` then increments the <<numFailures, number of failures>> for `tid` task and checks if the number of failures is equal or greater than the <<maxTaskFailures, allowed number of task failures per `TaskSet`>> (as defined when the <<creating-instance, `TaskSetManager` was created>>).

If so, i.e. the number of task failures of `tid` task reached the maximum value, you should see the following ERROR message in the logs:

```
ERROR Task [id] in stage [id] failed [maxTaskFailures] times; aborting job
```

And `handleFailedTask` <<abort, aborts the `TaskSet`>> with the following message and then quits:

```
Task [index] in stage [id] failed [maxTaskFailures] times, most recent failure: [failureReason]
```

In the end (except when the number of failures of `tid` task grew beyond the acceptable number), `handleFailedTask` <<maybeFinishTaskSet, attempts to mark the `TaskSet` as finished>>.

[NOTE]
====
`handleFailedTask` is used when:

* `TaskSchedulerImpl` is requested to TaskSchedulerImpl.md#handleFailedTask[handle a failed task]

* `TaskSetManager` is requested to <<handleSuccessfulTask, handle a successful task>> and <<executorLost, handle a lost executor>>
====

==== [[handleFailedTask-FetchFailed]] `FetchFailed` TaskFailedReason

For `FetchFailed` you should see the following WARN message in the logs:

```
WARN Lost task [id] in stage [id] (TID [tid], [host], executor [id]): [reason]
```

Unless `tid` has already been marked as successful (in <<successful, successful>> internal registry), it becomes so and the <<tasksSuccessful, number of successful tasks in `TaskSet`>> gets increased.

The `TaskSetManager` enters <<isZombie, zombie state>>.

The failure exception is empty.

==== [[handleFailedTask-ExceptionFailure]] `ExceptionFailure` TaskFailedReason

For `ExceptionFailure`, `handleFailedTask` checks if the exception is of type `NotSerializableException`. If so, you should see the following ERROR message in the logs:

```
ERROR Task [id] in stage [id] (TID [tid]) had a not serializable result: [description]; not retrying
```

And `handleFailedTask` <<abort, aborts the `TaskSet`>> and then quits.

Otherwise, if the exception is not of type `NotSerializableException`, `handleFailedTask` accesses accumulators and calculates whether to print the WARN message (with the failure reason) or the INFO message.

If the failure has already been reported (and is therefore a duplication), configuration-properties.md#spark.logging.exceptionPrintInterval[spark.logging.exceptionPrintInterval] is checked before reprinting the duplicate exception in its entirety.

For full printout of the `ExceptionFailure`, the following WARN appears in the logs:

```
WARN Lost task [id] in stage [id] (TID [tid], [host], executor [id]): [reason]
```

Otherwise, the following INFO appears in the logs:

```
INFO Lost task [id] in stage [id] (TID [tid]) on [host], executor [id]: [className] ([description]) [duplicate [dupCount]]
```

The exception in `ExceptionFailure` becomes the failure exception.

==== [[handleFailedTask-ExecutorLostFailure]] `ExecutorLostFailure` TaskFailedReason

For `ExecutorLostFailure` if not `exitCausedByApp`, you should see the following INFO in the logs:

```
INFO Task [tid] failed because while it was being computed, its executor exited for a reason unrelated to the task. Not counting this failure towards the maximum number of failures for the task.
```

The failure exception is empty.

==== [[handleFailedTask-TaskFailedReason]] Other TaskFailedReasons

For the other TaskFailedReasons, you should see the following WARN message in the logs:

```
WARN Lost task [id] in stage [id] (TID [tid], [host], executor [id]): [reason]
```

The failure exception is empty.

=== [[addPendingTask]] Registering Task As Pending Execution (Per Preferred Locations) -- `addPendingTask` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
addPendingTask(index: Int): Unit
----

`addPendingTask` registers a `index` task in the pending-task lists that the task should be eventually scheduled to (per its preferred locations).

Internally, `addPendingTask` takes the Task.md#preferredLocations[preferred locations of the task] (given `index`) and registers the task in the internal pending-task registries for every preferred location:

* <<pendingTasksForExecutor, pendingTasksForExecutor>> when the TaskLocation.md[TaskLocation] is `ExecutorCacheTaskLocation`.
* <<pendingTasksForHost, pendingTasksForHost>> for the hosts of a TaskLocation.md[TaskLocation].
* <<pendingTasksForRack, pendingTasksForRack>> for the TaskSchedulerImpl.md#getRackForHost[racks from  `TaskSchedulerImpl` per the host] (of a TaskLocation.md[TaskLocation]).

For a TaskLocation.md[TaskLocation] being `HDFSCacheTaskLocation`, `addPendingTask` TaskSchedulerImpl.md#getExecutorsAliveOnHost[requests `TaskSchedulerImpl` for the executors on the host] (of a preferred location) and registers the task in <<pendingTasksForExecutor, pendingTasksForExecutor>> for every executor (if available).

You should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO Pending task [index] has a cached location at [host] , where there are executors [executors]
```

When `addPendingTask` could not find executors for a `HDFSCacheTaskLocation` preferred location, you should see the following DEBUG message in the logs:

```
DEBUG Pending task [index] has a cached location at [host] , but there are no executors alive there.
```

If the task has no location preferences, `addPendingTask` registers it in <<pendingTasksWithNoPrefs, pendingTasksWithNoPrefs>>.

`addPendingTask` always registers the task in <<allPendingTasks, allPendingTasks>>.

NOTE: `addPendingTask` is used immediatelly when `TaskSetManager` <<creating-instance, is created>> and later when handling a <<handleFailedTask, task failure>> or <<executorLost, lost executor>>.

=== [[executorLost]] Re-enqueuing ShuffleMapTasks (with no ExternalShuffleService) and Reporting All Running Tasks on Lost Executor as Failed -- `executorLost` Method

[source, scala]
----
executorLost(execId: String, host: String, reason: ExecutorLossReason): Unit
----

`executorLost` re-enqueues all the ShuffleMapTask.md[ShuffleMapTasks] that have completed already on the lost executor (when [external shuffle service](../external-shuffle-service/index.md) is not in use) and <<handleFailedTask, reports all currently-running tasks on the lost executor as failed>>.

NOTE: `executorLost` is part of the spark-scheduler-Schedulable.md#contract[Schedulable contract] that TaskSchedulerImpl.md#removeExecutor[`TaskSchedulerImpl` uses to inform `TaskSetManagers` about lost executors].

NOTE: Since `TaskSetManager` manages execution of the tasks in a single TaskSet.md[TaskSet], when an executor gets lost, the affected tasks that have been running on the failed executor need to be re-enqueued. `executorLost` is the mechanism to "announce" the event to all `TaskSetManagers`.

Internally, `executorLost` first checks whether the <<tasks, tasks>> are ShuffleMapTask.md[ShuffleMapTasks] and whether an [external shuffle service](../external-shuffle-service/index.md) is enabled (that could serve the map shuffle outputs in case of failure).

NOTE: `executorLost` checks out the first task in <<tasks, tasks>> as it is assumed the other belong to the same stage. If the task is a ShuffleMapTask.md[ShuffleMapTask], the entire <<taskSet, TaskSet>> is for a ShuffleMapStage.md[ShuffleMapStage].

NOTE: `executorLost` uses core:SparkEnv.md#blockManager[`SparkEnv` to access the current `BlockManager`] and finds out whether an storage:BlockManager.md#externalShuffleServiceEnabled[external shuffle service is enabled] or not (based on [spark.shuffle.service.enabled](../external-shuffle-service/configuration-properties.md#spark.shuffle.service.enabled) configuration property).

If `executorLost` is indeed due to an executor lost that executed tasks for a ShuffleMapStage.md[ShuffleMapStage] (that this `TaskSetManager` manages) and no external shuffle server is enabled, `executorLost` finds <<taskInfos, all the tasks>> that were scheduled on this lost executor and marks the <<successful, ones that were already successfully completed>> as not executed yet.

NOTE: `executorLost` uses records every tasks on the lost executor in <<successful, successful>> (as `false`) and decrements <<copiesRunning copiesRunning>>, and <<tasksSuccessful, tasksSuccessful>> for every task.

`executorLost` <<addPendingTask, registers every task as pending execution (per preferred locations)>> and DAGScheduler.md#taskEnded[informs `DAGScheduler` that the tasks (on the lost executor) have ended] (with DAGScheduler.md#handleTaskCompletion-Resubmitted[Resubmitted] reason).

NOTE: `executorLost` uses TaskSchedulerImpl.md#dagScheduler[`TaskSchedulerImpl` to access the `DAGScheduler`]. `TaskSchedulerImpl` is given when the <<creating-instance, `TaskSetManager` was created>>.

Regardless of whether this `TaskSetManager` manages `ShuffleMapTasks` or not (it could also manage ResultTask.md[ResultTasks]) and whether the external shuffle service is used or not, `executorLost` finds all <<taskInfos, currently-running tasks>> on this lost executor and <<handleFailedTask, reports them as failed>> (with the task state `FAILED`).

NOTE: `executorLost` finds out if the reason for the executor lost is due to application fault, i.e. assumes ``ExecutorExited``'s exit status as the indicator, `ExecutorKilled` for non-application's fault and any other reason is an application fault.

`executorLost` <<recomputeLocality, recomputes locality preferences>>.

## <span id="canFetchMoreResults"> Checking Available Memory For More Task Results

```scala
canFetchMoreResults(
  size: Long): Boolean
```

`canFetchMoreResults` checks whether there is enough memory to fetch the result of a task.

Internally, `canFetchMoreResults` increments the internal <<totalResultSize, totalResultSize>> with the input `size` (which is the size of the result of a task) and increments the internal <<calculatedTasks, calculatedTasks>>.

If the current internal <<totalResultSize, totalResultSize>> is bigger than the configuration-properties.md#maxResultSize[maximum result size], `canFetchMoreResults` prints out the following ERROR message to the logs:

```text
Total size of serialized results of [calculatedTasks] tasks ([totalResultSize]) is bigger than spark.driver.maxResultSize ([maxResultSize])
```

In the end, `canFetchMoreResults` <<abort, aborts>> the <<taskSet, TaskSet>> and returns `false`.

Otherwise, `canFetchMoreResults` returns `true`.

`canFetchMoreResults` is used when `TaskResultGetter` is requested to [enqueue a successful task](TaskResultGetter.md#enqueueSuccessfulTask).
