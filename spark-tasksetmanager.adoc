== [[TaskSetManager]] TaskSetManager

`TaskSetManager` is a <<schedulable, Schedulable>> that manages execution of the tasks in a single link:spark-taskscheduler-tasksets.adoc[TaskSet].

<<creating-instance, `TaskSetManager` is created>> when link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc#createTaskSetManager[`TaskSchedulerImpl` submits tasks (for a given `TaskSet`)].

The responsibilities of a `TaskSetManager` include (follow along the links to learn more in the corresponding sections):

* <<scheduling-tasks, Scheduling the tasks in a taskset>>
* <<task-retries, Retrying tasks on failure>>
* <<locality-aware-scheduling, Locality-aware scheduling via delay scheduling>>

[TIP]
====
Enable DEBUG logging levels for `org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskSchedulerImpl` (or `org.apache.spark.scheduler.cluster.YarnScheduler` for YARN) and `org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskSetManager` and execute the following two-stage job to see their low-level innerworkings.

A cluster manager is recommended since it gives more task localization choices (with YARN supporting rack localization).

.TaskSetManager's Internal Registries and Counters
[cols="1,2",options="header",width="100%"]
|===
| Name | Description
| [[calculatedTasks]] `calculatedTasks` | The number of the tasks that have already completed execution.

Starts from `0` when a <<creating-instance, `TaskSetManager` is created>> and is only incremented when the <<canFetchMoreResults, `TaskSetManager` checks that there is enough memory to fetch a task result>>.

| [[copiesRunning]] `copiesRunning` | The number of task copies currently running per task (index in its task set).

The number of task copies of a task is increased when <<resourceOffer, dequeuing a task for execution>> or <<checkSpeculatableTasks, checking for speculatable tasks>> and decreased when <<handleFailedTask, a task fails>> or <<executorLost, an executor is lost>> (for a shuffle map stage and no external shuffle service).

| [[failedExecutors]] `failedExecutors` | Lookup table of TaskInfo's indices that failed to executor ids and the time of the failure.

Used in <<handleFailedTask, handleFailedTask>>.

| [[isZombie]] `isZombie` | Disabled, i.e. `false`, by default.

Read <<zombie-state, Zombie state>> in this document.

| [[runningTasksSet]] `runningTasksSet` | Collection of running tasks that a `TaskSetManager` manages.

Used to implement <<runningTasks, runningTasks>> (that is simply the size of `runningTasksSet` but a required part of any link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulable.adoc#contract[Schedulable]). `runningTasksSet` is expanded when <<addRunningTask, registering a running task>> and shrinked when <<removeRunningTask, unregistering a running task>>.

Used in link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc#cancelTasks[`TaskSchedulerImpl` to cancel tasks].

| [[taskInfos]] `taskInfos` | Lookup table of ``TaskInfo``s per task id.

A task's id and `TaskInfo` are added when <<resourceOffer, the task is dequeued for execution>>. It _appears_ that the entires stay forever, i.e. are never removed.

| `stageId` | The stage's id a `TaskSetManager` runs for.

Set when <<creating-instance, `TaskSetManager` is created>>.

It is a part of link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulable.adoc#contract[Schedulable Contract].

| [[totalResultSize]] `totalResultSize` | The current total size of the result of all the tasks that have finished.

Starts from `0` when <<creating-instance, `TaskSetManager` is created>>.

Only increased with the size of a task result whenever a `TaskSetManager` <<canFetchMoreResults, checks that there is enough memory to fetch the task result>>.

| `allPendingTasks`
|

| [[localityWaits]] `localityWaits`
|

| [[numFailures]] `numFailures`
|

| [[pendingTasksForExecutor]] `pendingTasksForExecutor`
|

| `pendingTasksForHost` |
| `pendingTasksForRack` |
| `pendingTasksWithNoPrefs` |

| `recentExceptions` |

| `speculatableTasks` |

| [[successful]] `successful` |

| [[taskAttempts]] `taskAttempts` |
| [[tasks]] `tasks` |
| [[tasksSuccessful]] `tasksSuccessful` |

[TIP]
====
Enable `DEBUG` logging level for `org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskSetManager` logger to see what happens inside.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

```
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskSetManager=DEBUG
```

Refer to link:spark-logging.adoc[Logging].
====

=== [[creating-instance]] Creating TaskSetManager Instance

`TaskSetManager` takes the following when created:

* [[sched]] link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc[TaskSchedulerImpl]
* [[taskSet]] link:spark-taskscheduler-tasksets.adoc[TaskSet]
* [[maxTaskFailures]] `maxTaskFailures`
* [[blacklistTracker]] (optional) BlacklistTracker
* [[clock]] `Clock` (defaults to `SystemClock`)

`TaskSetManager` initializes the <<internal-registries, internal registries and counters>>.

`TaskSetManager` requests the link:spark-service-mapoutputtracker.adoc#getEpoch[current epoch from `MapOutputTracker`] and sets it on all tasks in the taskset.

You should see the following DEBUG in the logs:

```
DEBUG Epoch for [taskSet]: [epoch]
```

CAUTION: FIXME What's epoch. Why is this important?

NOTE: `TaskSetManager` requests link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc#mapOutputTracker[`MapOutputTracker` from `TaskSchedulerImpl`] which is _likely_ for unit testing only since link:spark-sparkenv.adoc#mapOutputTracker[`MapOutputTracker` is available using `SparkEnv`].

=== [[addPendingTask]] `addPendingTask` Method

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[dequeueSpeculativeTask]] `dequeueSpeculativeTask` Method

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[dequeueTask]] `dequeueTask` Method

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[executorAdded]] `executorAdded` Method

`executorAdded` simply calls <<recomputeLocality, recomputeLocality>> method.

=== [[abortIfCompletelyBlacklisted]] `abortIfCompletelyBlacklisted` Method

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[schedulable]] TaskSetManager is Schedulable

`TaskSetManager` is a link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulable.adoc[Schedulable] with the following implementation:

* `name` is `TaskSet_[taskSet.stageId.toString]`
* no `parent` is ever assigned, i.e. it is always `null`.
+
It means that it can only be a leaf in the tree of Schedulables (with link:spark-taskscheduler-pool.adoc[Pools] being the nodes).

* `schedulingMode` always returns `SchedulingMode.NONE` (since there is nothing to schedule).
* `weight` is always `1`.
* `minShare` is always `0`.
* `runningTasks` is the number of running tasks in the internal  `runningTasksSet`.
* `priority` is the priority of the owned link:spark-taskscheduler-tasksets.adoc[TaskSet] (using `taskSet.priority`).
* `stageId` is the stage id of the owned link:spark-taskscheduler-tasksets.adoc[TaskSet] (using `taskSet.stageId`).

* `schedulableQueue` returns no queue, i.e. `null`.
* `addSchedulable` and `removeSchedulable` do nothing.
* `getSchedulableByName` always returns `null`.

* `getSortedTaskSetQueue` returns a one-element collection with the sole element being itself.

* <<executorLost, executorLost>>
* <<checkSpeculatableTasks, checkSpeculatableTasks>>

=== [[handleTaskGettingResult]] Marking Task As Fetching Indirect Result -- `handleTaskGettingResult` Method

[source, scala]
----
handleTaskGettingResult(tid: Long): Unit
----

`handleTaskGettingResult` looks the `TaskInfo` for the task id `tid` up in <<taskInfos, `taskInfos` internal registry>> and marks it as fetching indirect task result. It then link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#taskGettingResult[notifies `DAGScheduler`].

NOTE: `handleTaskGettingResult` is executed when link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc#handleTaskGettingResult[`TaskSchedulerImpl` is notified about fetching indirect task result].

=== [[addRunningTask]] Registering Running Task -- `addRunningTask` Method

[source, scala]
----
addRunningTask(tid: Long): Unit
----

`addRunningTask` adds `tid` to <<runningTasksSet, runningTasksSet>> internal registry and link:spark-taskscheduler-pool.adoc#increaseRunningTasks[requests the `parent` pool to increase the number of running tasks] (if defined).

=== [[removeRunningTask]] Unregistering Running Task -- `removeRunningTask` Method

[source, scala]
----
removeRunningTask(tid: Long): Unit
----

`removeRunningTask` removes `tid` from <<runningTasksSet, runningTasksSet>> internal registry and link:spark-taskscheduler-pool.adoc#decreaseRunningTasks[requests the `parent` pool to decrease the number of running task] (if defined).

=== [[executorLost]] Handling Executor Lost Events -- `executorLost` Method

NOTE: `executorLost` is part of the link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulable.adoc#contract[Schedulable Contract] which is called by link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc#removeExecutor[TaskSchedulerImpl] to inform `TaskSetManagers` about executors being lost.

Since `TaskSetManager` manages execution of the tasks in a single link:spark-taskscheduler-tasksets.adoc[TaskSet], when an executor gets lost, the affected tasks that have been running on the failed executor need to be re-enqueued. `executorLost` is the mechanism to "announce" the event to all `TaskSetManagers`.

`executorLost` first checks whether the `TaskSet` is for a link:spark-dagscheduler-ShuffleMapStage.adoc[ShuffleMapStage] (in which case all `TaskSet.tasks` are instances of link:spark-taskscheduler-ShuffleMapTask.adoc[ShuffleMapTask]) as well as whether an link:spark-ExternalShuffleService.adoc[external shuffle server] is used (that could serve the shuffle outputs in case of failure).

If it is indeed for a failed link:spark-dagscheduler-ShuffleMapStage.adoc[ShuffleMapStage] and no external shuffle server is enabled, all successfully-completed tasks for the failed executor (using <<taskInfos, `taskInfos` internal registry>>) <<addPendingTask, are recorded as pending tasks>> and the link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#taskEnded[DAGScheduler is informed about resubmission] (as link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#handleTaskCompletion-Resubmitted[`Resubmitted` end reason]).

The <<internal-registries, internal registries>> - `successful`, `copiesRunning`, and `tasksSuccessful` - are updated.

Regardless of the above check, all currently-running tasks for the failed executor are <<handleFailedTask, reported as failed>> (with the task state being `FAILED`).

<<recomputeLocality, recomputeLocality>> is called.

=== [[checkSpeculatableTasks]] Checking Speculatable Tasks -- `checkSpeculatableTasks` Method

NOTE: `checkSpeculatableTasks` is part of the link:spark-taskscheduler-schedulable.adoc#contract[Schedulable Contract].

[source, scala]
----
checkSpeculatableTasks(minTimeToSpeculation: Int): Boolean
----

`checkSpeculatableTasks` checks whether there are speculatable tasks in a `TaskSet`.

NOTE: `checkSpeculatableTasks` is called when link:spark-taskschedulerimpl-speculative-execution.adoc[`TaskSchedulerImpl` checks for speculatable tasks].

If the TaskSetManager is <<zombie-state, zombie>> or has a single task in TaskSet, it assumes no speculatable tasks.

The method goes on with the assumption of no speculatable tasks by default.

It computes the minimum number of finished tasks for speculation (as link:spark-taskschedulerimpl-speculative-execution.adoc#spark_speculation_quantile[spark.speculation.quantile] of all the finished tasks).

You should see the DEBUG message in the logs:

```
DEBUG Checking for speculative tasks: minFinished = [minFinishedForSpeculation]
```

It then checks whether the number is equal or greater than the number of tasks completed successfully (using `tasksSuccessful`).

Having done that, it computes the median duration of all the successfully completed tasks (using <<taskInfos, `taskInfos` internal registry>>) and task length threshold using the median duration multiplied by link:spark-taskschedulerimpl-speculative-execution.adoc#spark_speculation_multiplier[spark.speculation.multiplier] that has to be equal or less than `100`.

You should see the DEBUG message in the logs:

```
DEBUG Task length threshold for speculation: [threshold]
```

For each task (using <<taskInfos, `taskInfos` internal registry>>) that is not marked as successful yet (using `successful`) for which there is only one copy running (using `copiesRunning`) and the task takes more time than the calculated threshold, but it was not in `speculatableTasks` it is assumed *speculatable*.

You should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO Marking task [index] in stage [taskSet.id] (on [info.host]) as speculatable because it ran more than [threshold] ms
```

The task gets added to the internal `speculatableTasks` collection. The method responds positively.

=== [[recomputeLocality]] `recomputeLocality` Method

`recomputeLocality` (re)computes locality levels as a indexed collection of task localities, i.e. `Array[TaskLocality.TaskLocality]`.

NOTE: `TaskLocality` is an enumeration with `PROCESS_LOCAL`, `NODE_LOCAL`, `NO_PREF`, `RACK_LOCAL`, `ANY` values.

The method starts with `currentLocalityIndex` being `0`.

It checks whether `pendingTasksForExecutor` has at least one element, and if so, it looks up <<settings, spark.locality.wait.*>> for `PROCESS_LOCAL` and checks whether there is an executor for which `TaskSchedulerImpl.isExecutorAlive` is `true`. If the checks pass, `PROCESS_LOCAL` becomes an element of the result collection of task localities.

The same checks are performed for `pendingTasksForHost`, `NODE_LOCAL`, and `TaskSchedulerImpl.hasExecutorsAliveOnHost` to add `NODE_LOCAL` to the result collection of task localities.

Then, the method checks `pendingTasksWithNoPrefs` and if it's not empty, `NO_PREF` becomes an element of the levels collection.

If `pendingTasksForRack` is not empty, and the wait time for `RACK_LOCAL` is defined, and there is an executor for which `TaskSchedulerImpl.hasHostAliveOnRack` is `true`, `RACK_LOCAL` is added to the levels collection.

`ANY` is the last and always-added element in the levels collection.

Right before the method finishes, it prints out the following DEBUG to the logs:

```
DEBUG Valid locality levels for [taskSet]: [levels]
```

`myLocalityLevels`, `localityWaits`, and `currentLocalityIndex` are recomputed.

=== [[resourceOffer]] `resourceOffer` Method

CAUTION: FIXME Review `TaskSetManager.resourceOffer` + Does this have anything related to the following section about scheduling tasks?

[source, scala]
----
resourceOffer(
  execId: String,
  host: String,
  maxLocality: TaskLocality): Option[TaskDescription]
----

When a `TaskSetManager` is a <<zombie-state, zombie>>, `resourceOffer` returns no link:spark-TaskDescription.adoc[TaskDescription] (i.e. `None`).

For a non-zombie `TaskSetManager`, `resourceOffer`...FIXME

CAUTION: FIXME

It dequeues a pending task from the taskset by checking pending tasks per executor (using `pendingTasksForExecutor`), host (using `pendingTasksForHost`), with no localization preferences (using `pendingTasksWithNoPrefs`), rack (uses `TaskSchedulerImpl.getRackForHost` that seems to return "non-zero" value for link:yarn/spark-yarn-yarnscheduler.adoc[YarnScheduler] only)

From `TaskSetManager.resourceOffer`:

```
INFO TaskSetManager: Starting task 0.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 0, 192.168.1.4, partition 0,PROCESS_LOCAL, 1997 bytes)
```

If a serialized task is bigger than `100` kB (it is not a configurable value), a WARN message is printed out to the logs (only once per taskset):

```
WARN TaskSetManager: Stage [task.stageId] contains a task of very large size ([serializedTask.limit / 1024] KB). The maximum recommended task size is 100 KB.
```

A task id is added to `runningTasksSet` set and <<parent-pool, parent pool>> notified (using `increaseRunningTasks(1)` up the chain of pools).

The following INFO message appears in the logs:

```
INFO TaskSetManager: Starting task [id] in stage [taskSet.id] (TID [taskId], [host], partition [task.partitionId],[taskLocality], [serializedTask.limit] bytes)
```

For example:

```
INFO TaskSetManager: Starting task 1.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 1, localhost, partition 1,PROCESS_LOCAL, 2054 bytes)
```

=== [[scheduling-tasks]] Scheduling Tasks in TaskSet

CAUTION: FIXME

For each submitted <<taskset, TaskSet>>, a new TaskSetManager is created. The TaskSetManager completely and exclusively owns a TaskSet submitted for execution.

CAUTION: FIXME A picture with `TaskSetManager` owning TaskSet

CAUTION: FIXME What component knows about TaskSet and TaskSetManager. Isn't it that TaskSets are *created* by  DAGScheduler while TaskSetManager is used by TaskSchedulerImpl only?

TaskSetManager keeps track of the tasks pending execution per executor, host, rack or with no locality preferences.

=== [[locality-aware-scheduling]] Locality-Aware Scheduling aka Delay Scheduling

TaskSetManager computes locality levels for the TaskSet for delay scheduling. While computing you should see the following DEBUG in the logs:

```
DEBUG Valid locality levels for [taskSet]:  [levels]
```

CAUTION: FIXME What's delay scheduling?

=== [[events]] Events

Once a task has finished, `TaskSetManager` informs link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#taskEnded[DAGScheduler].

CAUTION: FIXME

=== [[handleSuccessfulTask]] Recording Successful Task And Notifying DAGScheduler -- `handleSuccessfulTask` Method

[source, scala]
----
handleSuccessfulTask(tid: Long, result: DirectTaskResult[_]): Unit
----

`handleSuccessfulTask` records the `tid` task as finished, link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#taskEnded[notifies the `DAGScheduler` that the task has ended] and <<maybeFinishTaskSet, attempts to mark the `TaskSet` finished>>.

NOTE: `handleSuccessfulTask` is executed after link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc#handleSuccessfulTask[`TaskSchedulerImpl` has been informed that `tid` task finished successfully (and the task result was deserialized)].

CAUTION: FIXME Describe `TaskInfo`

Internally, `handleSuccessfulTask` looks `TaskInfo` up (in <<taskInfos, `taskInfos` internal registry>>) and records it as `FINISHED`.

It then removes `tid` task from <<runningTasksSet, runningTasksSet>> internal registry.

`handleSuccessfulTask` link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#taskEnded[notifies `DAGScheduler` that `tid` task ended successfully] (with the `Task` object from <<tasks, tasks>> internal registry and the result as `Success`).

At this point, `handleSuccessfulTask` looks up the other <<taskAttempts, running task attempts>> of `tid` task and link:spark-SchedulerBackend.adoc#killTask[requests `SchedulerBackend` to kill them]. You should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO Killing attempt [attemptNumber] for task [id] in stage [id] (TID [id]) on [host] as the attempt [attemptNumber] succeeded on [host]
```

CAUTION: FIXME Review `taskAttempts`

If `tid` has _not_ yet been recorded as <<successful, successful>>, `handleSuccessfulTask` increases <<tasksSuccessful, tasksSuccessful>> counter. You should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO Finished task [id] in stage [id] (TID [taskId]) in [duration] ms on [host] (executor [executorId]) ([tasksSuccessful]/[numTasks])
```

`tid` task is marked as <<successful, successful>>. If the number of task that have finished successfully is exactly the number of the tasks to execute (in the `TaskSet`), the `TaskSetManager` becomes a <<isZombie, zombie>>.

If `tid` task was already recorded as <<successful, successful>>, you should _merely_ see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO Ignoring task-finished event for [id] in stage [id] because task [index] has already completed successfully
```

Ultimately, `handleSuccessfulTask` <<maybeFinishTaskSet, attempts to mark the `TaskSet` finished>>.

=== [[maybeFinishTaskSet]] Attempting to Mark TaskSet Finished -- `maybeFinishTaskSet` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
maybeFinishTaskSet(): Unit
----

`maybeFinishTaskSet` link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc#taskSetFinished[notifies `TaskSchedulerImpl` that a `TaskSet` has finished] when there are no other <<runningTasksSet, running tasks>> and the <<isZombie, TaskSetManager is not in zombie state>>.

=== [[handleFailedTask]] `handleFailedTask` Method

[source, scala]
----
handleFailedTask(
  tid: Long,
  state: TaskState,
  reason: TaskFailedReason): Unit
----

`handleFailedTask` <<removeRunningTask, removes `tid` task from the internal registry of running tasks>> and marks `TaskInfo` as finished. It decreases the number of the `tid` task's copies running (in <<copiesRunning, copiesRunning>> internal registry).

NOTE: `handleFailedTask` is executed after link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc#handleFailedTask[`TaskSchedulerImpl` has been informed that `tid` task failed] or <<executorLost, executorLost>>. In either case, tasks could not finish successfully or could not report it back.

NOTE: With link:spark-taskschedulerimpl-speculative-execution.adoc[speculative xecution of tasks] enabled, there can be many copies of a task running simultaneuosly.

When executed, `handleFailedTask` first checks out the status of the `tid` task. If the `tid` task has already been marked as failed or killed (in <<taskInfos, taskInfos>> internal registry), `handleFailedTask` does nothing and quits.

If however the task has not been registered as failed or killed before, `handleFailedTask` <<removeRunningTask, unregisters the task as running>> and marks it as finished with `state`. The number of the running copies of the task (as recorded in <<copiesRunning, `copiesRunning` internal registry>>) is decremented.

CAUTION: FIXME How is `copiesRunning` used?

`handleFailedTask` uses the following pattern as the reason for the failure:

```
Lost task [id] in stage [taskSetId] (TID [tid], [host], executor [executorId]): [reason]
```

`handleFailedTask` then calculates the failure exception for the input `reason`, i.e. <<handleFailedTask-FetchFailed, FetchFailed>>, <<handleFailedTask-ExceptionFailure, ExceptionFailure>>, <<handleFailedTask-ExecutorLostFailure, ExecutorLostFailure>> and <<handleFailedTask-TaskFailedReason, other TaskFailedReasons>>.

NOTE: Calculation of the failure exception was moved to their own sections below to make the reading a bit more pleasant and comprehensible.

`handleFailedTask` link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#taskEnded[informs `DAGScheduler` that the `tid` task has ended] (with the `Task` instance from <<tasks, tasks>> internal registry, the reason, and no result, i.e. `null`).

If the `tid` task has already been marked as successful (in <<successful, successful>> internal registry) you should see the following INFO message in the logs:

```
INFO Task [id] in stage [id] (TID [tid]) failed, but another instance of the task has already succeeded, so not re-queuing the task to be re-executed.
```

TIP: Refer to link:spark-taskschedulerimpl-speculative-execution.adoc[Speculative Execution of Tasks] to learn why a single task could be executed multiple times at the same time.

If the `tid` task was not recorded as <<successful, successful>>, the task is <<addPendingTask, recorded as a pending task>>.

Unless the `TaskSetManager` is a <<zombie-state, zombie>> or the task failure should _not_ be counted towards the maximum number of times the task is allowed to fail before the stage is aborted (i.e. `TaskFailedReason.countTowardsTaskFailures` is enabled), the optional link:#updateBlacklistForFailedTask[`TaskSetBlacklist` is updated].

`handleFailedTask` increments <<numFailures, numFailures>> for `tid` and makes sure that it is not equal or greater than the allowed number of task failures per `TaskSet` (as specified when the <<creating-instance, `TaskSetManager` was created>>).

If so, i.e. the number of task failures of `tid` reached the maximum value, you should see the following ERROR message in the logs:

```
ERROR Task [id] in stage [id] failed [maxTaskFailures] times; aborting job
```

And `handleFailedTask` <<abort, aborts the `TaskSet`>> and then quits.

In the end, `handleFailedTask` <<maybeFinishTaskSet, attempts to mark the `TaskSet` as finished>>.

CAUTION: FIXME image with `handleFailedTask` (and perhaps the other parties involved)

==== [[handleFailedTask-FetchFailed]] `FetchFailed` TaskFailedReason

For `FetchFailed` you should see the following WARN message in the logs:

```
WARN Lost task [id] in stage [id] (TID [tid], [host], executor [id]): [reason]
```

Unless `tid` has already been marked as successful (in <<successful, successful>> internal registry), it becomes so and the <<tasksSuccessful, number of successful tasks in `TaskSet`>> gets increased.

The `TaskSetManager` enters <<isZombie, zombie state>>.

The failure exception is empty.

==== [[handleFailedTask-ExceptionFailure]] `ExceptionFailure` TaskFailedReason

For `ExceptionFailure`, `handleFailedTask` checks if the exception is of type `NotSerializableException`. If so, you should see the following ERROR message in the logs:

```
ERROR Task [id] in stage [id] (TID [tid]) had a not serializable result: [description]; not retrying
```

And `handleFailedTask` <<abort, aborts the `TaskSet`>> and then quits.

Otherwise, if the exception is not of type `NotSerializableException`, `handleFailedTask` accesses accumulators and calculates whether to print the WARN message (with the failure reason) or the INFO message.

If the failure has already been reported (and is therefore a duplication), <<spark_logging_exceptionPrintInterval, spark.logging.exceptionPrintInterval>> is checked before reprinting the duplicate exception in its entirety.

For full printout of the `ExceptionFailure`, the following WARN appears in the logs:

```
WARN Lost task [id] in stage [id] (TID [tid], [host], executor [id]): [reason]
```

Otherwise, the following INFO appears in the logs:

```
INFO Lost task [id] in stage [id] (TID [tid]) on [host], executor [id]: [className] ([description]) [duplicate [dupCount]]
```

The exception in `ExceptionFailure` becomes the failure exception.

==== [[handleFailedTask-ExecutorLostFailure]] `ExecutorLostFailure` TaskFailedReason

For `ExecutorLostFailure` if not `exitCausedByApp`, you should see the following INFO in the logs:

```
INFO Task [tid] failed because while it was being computed, its executor exited for a reason unrelated to the task. Not counting this failure towards the maximum number of failures for the task.
```

The failure exception is empty.

==== [[handleFailedTask-TaskFailedReason]] Other TaskFailedReasons

For the other TaskFailedReasons, you should see the following WARN message in the logs:

```
WARN Lost task [id] in stage [id] (TID [tid], [host], executor [id]): [reason]
```

The failure exception is empty.

=== [[task-retries]] Retrying Tasks on Failure

CAUTION: FIXME

Up to link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc#spark_task_maxFailures[spark.task.maxFailures] attempts

=== Task retries and `spark.task.maxFailures`

When you start Spark program you set up link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc#spark_task_maxFailures[spark.task.maxFailures] for the number of failures that are acceptable until TaskSetManager gives up and marks a job failed.

TIP: In Spark shell with local master, `spark.task.maxFailures` is fixed to `1` and you need to use link:spark-local.adoc[local-with-retries master] to change it to some other value.

In the following example, you are going to execute a job with two partitions and keep one failing at all times (by throwing an exception). The aim is to learn the behavior of retrying task execution in a stage in TaskSet. You will only look at a single task execution, namely `0.0`.

=== [[zombie-state]] Zombie state

A `TaskSetManager` is in *zombie* state when all tasks in a taskset have completed successfully (regardless of the number of task attempts), or if the taskset has been <<abort, aborted>>.

While in zombie state, a `TaskSetManager` can launch no new tasks and <<resourceOffer, responds with no `TaskDescription` to resourceOffers>>.

A `TaskSetManager` remains in the zombie state until all tasks have finished running, i.e. to continue to track and account for the running tasks.

=== [[abort]] Aborting TaskSet -- `abort` Method

[source, scala]
----
abort(message: String, exception: Option[Throwable] = None): Unit
----

`abort` informs link:spark-dagscheduler.adoc#taskSetFailed[`DAGScheduler` that the `TaskSet` has been aborted].

CAUTION: FIXME image with DAGScheduler call

The TaskSetManager enters <<zombie-state, zombie state>>.

Finally, `abort` <<maybeFinishTaskSet, attempts to mark the `TaskSet` finished>>.

=== [[canFetchMoreResults]] Checking Available Memory For Task Result -- `canFetchMoreResults` Method

[source, scala]
----
canFetchMoreResults(size: Long): Boolean
----

`canFetchMoreResults` checks whether there is enough memory to fetch the result of a task.

Internally, `canFetchMoreResults` increments the internal <<totalResultSize, totalResultSize>> with the input `size` which is the result of a task. It also increments the internal <<calculatedTasks, calculatedTasks>>.

If the current internal <<totalResultSize, totalResultSize>> is bigger than  <<spark_driver_maxResultSize, spark.driver.maxResultSize>> the following ERROR message is printed out to the logs:

```
ERROR TaskSetManager: Total size of serialized results of [calculatedTasks] tasks ([totalResultSize]) is bigger than spark.driver.maxResultSize ([maxResultSize])
```

The current link:spark-taskscheduler-tasksets.adoc[TaskSet] is <<abort, aborted>> and `canFetchMoreResults` returns `false`.

Otherwise, `canFetchMoreResults` returns `true`.

NOTE: `canFetchMoreResults` is used in link:spark-taskschedulerimpl-TaskResultGetter.adoc#enqueueSuccessfulTask[TaskResultGetter.enqueueSuccessfulTask] only.

=== [[computeValidLocalityLevels]] Computing Locality Levels (for Scheduled Tasks) -- `computeValidLocalityLevels` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
computeValidLocalityLevels(): Array[TaskLocality]
----

`computeValidLocalityLevels` computes valid locality levels for tasks that were registered in corresponding registries per locality level.

NOTE: link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc[TaskLocality] is a task locality preference and can be the most localized `NODE_LOCAL` through `NO_PREF` and `RACK_LOCAL` to `ANY`.

.TaskLocalities and Corresponding Internal Registries
[cols="1,2",options="header",width="100%"]
|===
| TaskLocality
| Internal Registry

| `PROCESS_LOCAL`
| <<pendingTasksForExecutor, pendingTasksForExecutor>>
| `NODE_LOCAL`
| <<pendingTasksForHost, pendingTasksForHost>>
| `NO_PREF`
| <<pendingTasksWithNoPrefs, pendingTasksWithNoPrefs>>
| `RACK_LOCAL`
| <<pendingTasksForRack, pendingTasksForRack>>

|===

`computeValidLocalityLevels` walks over every internal registry and if it is not empty <<getLocalityWait, computes locality wait>> for the corresponding `TaskLocality` and proceeds with it only when the locality wait is not `0`.

For `TaskLocality` with pending tasks, `computeValidLocalityLevels` asks `TaskSchedulerImpl` whether there is at least one executor alive (for link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc#isExecutorAlive[PROCESS_LOCAL], link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc#hasExecutorsAliveOnHost[NODE_LOCAL] and link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc#hasHostAliveOnRack[RACK_LOCAL]) and if so registers the `TaskLocality`.

NOTE: `computeValidLocalityLevels` uses <<sched, TaskSchedulerImpl>> that was given when <<TaskSetManager, `TaskSetManager` was created>>.

`computeValidLocalityLevels` always registers `ANY` task locality level.

In the end, you should see the following DEBUG message in the logs:

```
DEBUG TaskSetManager: Valid locality levels for [taskSet]: [comma-separated levels]
```

NOTE: `computeValidLocalityLevels` is used when `TaskSetManager` <<creating-instance, is created>> and later to <<recomputeLocality, recompute locality>>.

=== [[getLocalityWait]] Finding Locality Wait -- `getLocalityWait` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
getLocalityWait(level: TaskLocality): Long
----

`getLocalityWait` finds *locality wait* (in milliseconds) for a given link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc#TaskLocality[TaskLocality].

`getLocalityWait` uses <<spark.locality.wait, spark.locality.wait>> (default: `3s`) when the ``TaskLocality``-specific property is not defined or `0` for `NO_PREF` and `ANY`.

NOTE: `NO_PREF` and `ANY` task localities have no locality wait.

.TaskLocalities and Corresponding Spark Properties
[cols="1,2",options="header",width="100%"]
|===
| TaskLocality
| Spark Property

| PROCESS_LOCAL
| <<spark.locality.wait.process, spark.locality.wait.process>>

| NODE_LOCAL
| <<spark.locality.wait.node, spark.locality.wait.node>>

| RACK_LOCAL
| <<spark.locality.wait.rack, spark.locality.wait.rack>>
|===

NOTE: `getLocalityWait` is used when `TaskSetManager` calculates <<localityWaits, localityWaits>>, <<computeValidLocalityLevels, computes valid locality levels>> and <<recomputeLocality, recomputes locality preferences>>.

=== [[settings]] Settings

.Spark Properties
[options="header",width="100%"]
|===
| Spark Property | Default Value | Description
| [[spark_driver_maxResultSize]] `spark.driver.maxResultSize` | `1g` | The maximum size of all the task results in a `TaskSet`. If the value is smaller than `1m` or `1048576` (1024 * 1024), it is considered `0`.

Used when <<canFetchMoreResults, `TaskSetManager` checks available memory for a task result>> and `Utils.getMaxResultSize`.

| `spark.scheduler.executorTaskBlacklistTime` | `0L` | Time interval to pass after which a task can be re-launched on the executor where it has once failed. It is to prevent repeated task failures due to executor failures.

| [[spark_logging_exceptionPrintInterval]] `spark.logging.exceptionPrintInterval`
| `10000`
| How frequently to reprint duplicate exceptions in full (in millis).

| [[spark.locality.wait]] `spark.locality.wait`
| `3s`
| For locality-aware delay scheduling for `PROCESS_LOCAL`, `NODE_LOCAL`, and `RACK_LOCAL` link:spark-taskschedulerimpl.adoc#TaskLocality[TaskLocalities] when locality-specific setting is not set.
